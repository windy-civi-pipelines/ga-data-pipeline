By: Senators Tillery of the 19th, Dolezal of the 27th, Hatchett of the 50th, Bearden of the
30th, Moore of the 53rd and others
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Article 15 of Chapter 1 of Title 10 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated,
2 relating to deceptive or unfair practices, so as to protect the exercise of constitutional rights;
3 to prohibit discrimination in the provision of essential services; to provide for public and
4 private enforcement; to provide for definitions; to provide a short title; to provide legislative
5 findings and declarations; to provide for related matters; to repeal conflicting laws; and for
6 other purposes.
7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
8 SECTION 1.
9 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Freedom of Speech and Belief Act."
10 SECTION 2.
11 The General Assembly finds and declares that:
12 (1) The freedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights are fundamental to our nation;
13 (2) Among such rights is the freedom of association, which businesses and citizens of
14 this state may ordinarily exercise in choosing to engage or not to engage in business with
15 others;

25 LC 55 0603
16 (3) However, when the exercise of this freedom of association by businesses that provide
17 essential goods and services would threaten the ability of citizens of this state to freely
18 exercise their own constitutional rights, it is imperative that the General Assembly act to
19 ensure that the spirit and intent of the Bill of Rights is respected and that the freedoms
20 protected therein are preserved for the citizens of this state;
21 (4) The ability to obtain financial and utility services is essential to the citizens of this
22 state and to modern day life;
23 (5) Today, citizens of this state are at risk of being deprived the ability to obtain financial
24 and utility services due to such citizens' lawful exercise of their constitutional rights;
25 (6) Depriving citizens of this state financial and utility services would put such citizens
26 at an extreme disadvantage in carrying out the duties of daily life and would deprive such
27 citizens of the enjoyment of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and
28 (7) It is, therefore, incumbent on the General Assembly to preserve the ability of the
29 citizens of this state to obtain financial and utility services by prohibiting financial
30 institutions and utility service providers from depriving such citizens the provision of
31 such services based on such citizens' lawful exercise of their constitutional rights.
32 SECTION 3.
33 The General Assembly further finds and declares that:
34 (1) Legislation containing similar provisions of this Act was introduced in the Senate
35 during the 2025 regular session of the General Assembly, which was assigned Senate
36 Bill 57 as its bill number;
37 (2) On March 6, 2025, such legislation failed to achieve the requisite votes to pass the
38 Senate due, in part, to concerns that instances of discrimination by financial institutions
39 and other essential service providers are rare and that passage of such legislation could
40 result in frivolous litigation;
S. B. 341

25 LC 55 0603
41 (3) On March, 7, 2025, organizations affiliated with President Donald J. Trump filed suit
42 against Capitol One, N.A. alleging that Capitol One debanked such organizations by
43 terminating hundreds of accounts such organizations held with Capitol One without
44 warning and due to such organization's political affiliations, causing significant business
45 interruptions and considerable financial harm;
46 (4) On or about March 10, 2025, JPMorgan Chase, in response to credible allegations
47 that the company has engaged in debanking practices against its customers, updated its
48 code of conduct to protect its customers against future instances of political and religious
49 discrimination; and
50 (5) Such recent events, together with other instances of discrimination by financial
51 institutions, further demonstrate that the citizens of this state are at risk of being denied
52 essential services based on their constitutionally protected affiliations and activities and
53 that legislation is needed to protect the citizens of this state against such forms of
54 discrimination.
55 SECTION 4.
56 Article 15 of Chapter 1 of Title 10 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to
57 deceptive or unfair practices, is amended in Code Section 10-1-397, relating to cease and
58 desist orders, civil penalties, judicial relief, and receivers, by adding a new subsection to read
59 as follows:
60 "(g)(1) In any action brought pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this Code
61 section for a violation of Part 10 of this article, the court may, notwithstanding
62 subparagraph (B) of said paragraph, impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000.00 for the
63 first violation, up to $50,000.00 for a second violation, and up to $250,000.00 for a third
64 or subsequent violation and any such action may be brought without providing the notice
65 required under subsection (c) of this Code section.

67 General elects to not issue an order under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code
68 section or bring an action pursuant to paragraph (2) of said subsection, the Attorney
69 General shall prepare a report providing the reasons for not issuing such order or bringing
70 such action and shall publish such report on the Department of Law's public website.

73 to taking other actions required or authorized under this part, refer such financial
74 institution to the Department of Banking and Finance for investigation of any potential
