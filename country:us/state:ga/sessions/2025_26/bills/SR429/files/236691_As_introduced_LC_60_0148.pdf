By: Senators Burns of the 23rd, McLaurin of the 14th, Jones II of the 22nd, Payne of the 54th
and Halpern of the 39th
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the Senate Addressing Felony Disenfranchisement in Georgia's Constitution Study
2 Committee; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the civil rights of all individuals should be protected and respected; and
4 WHEREAS, felony disenfranchisement is a significant barrier to full reintegration into
5 society for individuals who have been convicted of a crime, but who have completed their
6 custodial sentence and are actively contributing to their community by paying taxes and
7 fulfilling other civic duties and responsibilities; and
8 WHEREAS, Georgia has one of the longest parole and probationary periods in the nation and
9 the highest number of individuals under supervision per capita of any state, which should not
10 serve as a barrier to the successful reintegration of individuals who have been released from
11 incarceration and are working to rebuild their lives and be invested in their communities; and
12 WHEREAS, Georgia's Constitution, under the felony disenfranchisement clause, currently
13 prevents individuals from fully participating in democracy by denying them the right to vote,
14 even after they have been released into their communities to serve the remainder of their
15 sentences and are engaged in their communities as law-abiding citizens; and
