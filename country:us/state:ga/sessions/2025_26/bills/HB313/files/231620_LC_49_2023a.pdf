A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Article 19A of Chapter 2 of Title 20 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated,
2 relating to American history recognition and significant documents, so as to authorize and
3 require all public elementary and secondary schools in this state to display the Ten
4 Commandments in multiple locations; to provide for specifications for such displays; to

6 matters; to provide for an effective date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.
7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
8 SECTION 1.
9 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
10 (1) In 2005, in the case of Van Orton v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005), the Supreme Court
11 of the United States recognized that it is permissible to display the Ten Commandments on
12 government property;
13 (2) In 2010, in the case of Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summan, 555 U.S. 460 (2006), the
14 Supreme Court of the United States acknowledged that the Ten Commandments may be
15 displayed on local government property when a private donation is made for the purchase
16 of the historical monument;

17 (3) In 2019, in the case of in American Legion v. American Humanist Association, 588
18 U.S. 29 (2019), the Supreme Court of the United States further recognized that the Ten
19 Commandments have historical significance as one of the foundations of our legal system,
20 and the court also ruled that displaying the Ten Commandments on public property may
21 reflect "historical significance" and represent "common cultural heritage";
22 (4) Inclusion in our education system recognizes the historical significance of the Ten
23 Commandments in the United States and the understanding of the nation's founders such
24 as James Madison, the fourth president of the United States of America, who stated, "We
25 have staked the whole future of our new nation â€¦ upon the capacity of each of ourselves
26 to govern ourselves, according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments";
27 (5) The Mayflower Compact of 1620 was America's first written constitution, it made a
28 covenant with Almighty God to "form a civil body politic," it was the first purely American
29 document of self-government, and it affirmed the link between civil society and God;
30 (6) The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 provided a method of admitting territories to the
31 union as the nation expanded westward and extended the fundamental principles of civil
32 and religious liberty to the territories, stating that "religion, morality, and knowledge being
33 necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of
34 education shall forever be encouraged"; and
35 (7) Inclusion of the Ten Commandments in the education of our children is part of our
36 state and national history, culture, and tradition.
37 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly:
38 (1) To apply the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Van Orton case
39 to continue the rich tradition and ensure that the students of our public schools may
40 understand and appreciate the foundational documents of our state and national
41 government;
42 (2) That this Act shall not create an unfunded mandate on any public school, local school
43 system, or local board of education; and

46 requirements of this Act.

122 to teach Americans to read and contained more than 40 questions about the Ten
123 Commandments. The Ten Commandments were also included in public school
124 textbooks published by educator William McGuffey, a noted university president and
125 professor. A version of his famous McGuffey Readers was written in the early 1800s
126 and became one of the most popular textbooks in the history of American education,
127 selling more than 100 million copies. Copies of the McGuffey Readers are still
128 available today. The Ten Commandments also appeared in a textbook published by
129 Noah Webster which was widely used in American public schools along with America's
130 first comprehensive dictionary that Webster also published. His textbook, The
131 American Spelling Book, contained the Ten Commandments and sold more than 100
132 million copies for use by public school children all across the nation and was still
133 available for use in American public schools in the year 1975.'
134 (5)(A) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any public school, local
