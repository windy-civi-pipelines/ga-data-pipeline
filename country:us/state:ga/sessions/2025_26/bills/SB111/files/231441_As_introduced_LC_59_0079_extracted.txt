291 to paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section as follows:
292 (1) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases
293 within 45 days of receipt of a request submitted pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code
294 section. The response period may be extended once by 45 additional days when

299 controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases within 45 days

306 complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the
307 burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, technically infeasible, excessive, or
308 repetitive nature of the request; and
309 (4) If a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable
310 efforts, then the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an
311 action under subsection (a) of this Code section and may request that the consumer
312 provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
313 consumer's request.
314 (c)(1) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's
315 refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's
316 receipt of the decision pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this Code section.
317 The appeal process shall be:
318 (A) Made available to the consumer in a conspicuous manner;
319 (B) Available at no cost to the consumer; and
320 (C) Similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to
321 subsection (a) of this Code section.
322 (2) Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in
323 writing of action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written
324 explanation of the reasons for the decision. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall
325 then also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method
326 through which the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.

336 (3) Establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
337 data security practices, as described in Code Section 10-1-973, to protect the

345 unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not discriminate against
346 a consumer for exercising the consumer rights contained in this article, including denying
347 goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing
348 a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer. However, this
349 paragraph shall not require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the
350 personal information of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain, or
351 prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of
352 goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the
353 consumer has exercised the right to opt out pursuant to subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2)
354 of subsection (a) of Code Section 10-1-963 or the offer is related to a consumer's

379 exercise the right to opt out of the processing.

25 LC 59 0079
380 (e)(1) A controller shall provide, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more
381 secure and reliable means for a consumer to submit a request to exercise the consumer
382 rights described in Code Section 10-1-963. Such means shall take into account the:
383 (A) Ways in which a consumer normally interacts with the controller;
384 (B) Need for secure and reliable communication of such requests; and
385 (C) Ability of a controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the
386 request.
387 (2) A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise
388 the consumer rights described in Code Section 10-1-963, but may require a consumer to
389 use an existing account.
390 10-1-965.
391 (a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller
392 in meeting its obligations under this article. The assistance provided by the processor shall
393 include:
394 (1) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
395 processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as reasonably
396 practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests
397 pursuant to Code Section 10-1-963; and
398 (2) Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document
399 data protection assessments pursuant to Code Section 10-1-966.
400 (b) A contract between a controller and a processor governs the processor's data processing
401 procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract
402 shall be binding and shall clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and
403 purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing,
404 and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements
405 that the processor shall:
S. B. 111
- 16 -
25 LC 59 0079
406 (1) Ensure that each person processing personal information is subject to a duty of
407 confidentiality with respect to the data;
408 (2) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal information to the controller
409 as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal
410 information is required by law;
411 (3) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all
412 information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with
413 the obligations in this article;
414 (4) Allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the
415 controller's designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified
416 and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and
417 technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this article
418 using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment
419 procedure for the assessments. The processor shall provide a report of each assessment
420 to the controller upon request; and
421 (5) Engage a subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in that requires the
422 subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal
423 information.
424 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities
425 imposed on it by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as described in
426 subsection (b) of this Code section.
427 (d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a
428 specific processing of data is a fact based determination that depends upon the context in
429 which personal information is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere to a
430 controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal information
431 remains a processor.
S. B. 111
- 17 -
25 LC 59 0079
432 10-1-966.
433 (a) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of the
434 following processing activities involving personal information:
435 (1) The processing of personal information for purposes of targeted advertising;
436 (2) The sale of personal information;
437 (3) The processing of personal information for purposes of profiling, where the profiling
438 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
439 (A) Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;
440 (B) Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;
441 (C) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs
442 or concerns, of consumers, where the intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable
443 person; or
444 (D) Other substantial injury to consumers;
445 (4) The processing of sensitive data; and
446 (5) Processing activities involving personal information that present a heightened risk
447 of harm to consumers.
448 (b) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section
449 shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the
450 processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the
451 potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by
452 safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks. The use of
453 de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of
454 the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose
455 personal information will be processed, shall be factored into this assessment by the
456 controller.
457 (c) The Attorney General may request pursuant to a civil investigative demand that a
458 controller disclose a data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation
S. B. 111
- 18 -
25 LC 59 0079
459 conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection
460 assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall evaluate the data
461 protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in Code
462 Section 10-1-964. The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request
463 from the Attorney General shall not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work
464 product protection with respect to the assessment and information contained in the
465 assessment. Such data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall not be open
466 to public inspection and copying under Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50, relating to open
467 records.
468 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing
469 operations that include similar activities.
470 (e) A data protection assessment conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance
471 with other laws, rules, or regulations may comply with this Code section if such data
472 protection assessment have a reasonably comparable scope and effect.
473 (f) The data protection assessment requirements in this article shall apply only to
474 processing activities created or generated on or after July 1, 2026.
475 10-1-967.
476 (a) A controller in possession of de-identified data shall:
477 (1) Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with a natural
478 person;
479 (2) Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to
480 reidentify the data; and
481 (3) Contractually obligate recipients of the de-identified data to comply with this article.
482 (b) Nothing in this Code section shall require a controller or processor to:
483 (1) Reidentify de-identified data or pseudonymous data;
S. B. 111
- 19 -
25 LC 59 0079
484 (2) Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access data or
485 technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with
486 personal information; or
487 (3) Comply with an authenticated consumer rights request, pursuant to Code
488 Section 10-1-963, if:
489 (A) The controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the
490 personal information or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to
491 associate the request with the personal information;
492 (B) The controller does not use the personal information to recognize or respond to the
493 specific consumer who is the subject of the personal information, or associate the
494 personal information with other personal information about the same specific
495 consumer; and
496 (C) The controller does not engage in the sale of personal information to a third party
497 or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal information to a third party other than a
498 processor, except as otherwise permitted in this Code section.
499 (c) The consumer rights described in Code Sections 10-1-963 and 10-1-964 shall not apply
500 to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to demonstrate information
501 necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical
502 and organizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing that information.
503 (d) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall exercise
504 reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with contractual commitments to which the
505 pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to
506 address breaches of those contractual commitments.
507 10-1-968.
508 (a) Nothing in this article shall restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:

515 (4) Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims;
516 (5) Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the parent or
517 legal guardian of a known child, perform a contract to which the consumer is a party,
518 including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty, or take steps at the request of the
519 consumer prior to entering into a contract;
520 (6) Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical
521 safety of the consumer or of another natural person, and where the processing cannot be
522 manifestly based on another legal basis;
523 (7) Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud,
524 harassment, malicious or deceptive activity, or illegal activity; preserve the integrity or
525 security of systems; or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for such action;
526 (8) Engage in public reviewed or peer reviewed scientific or statistical research in the
527 public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is
528 approved, monitored, and governed by an institutional review board, or similar
529 independent oversight entity that determines whether:
530 (A) Deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not
531 exclusively accrue to the controller;
532 (B) The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
533 (C) The controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks
534 associated with research, including risks associated with reidentification; or
535 (9) Assist another controller, processor, or third party with the obligations under this
536 article.
S. B. 111
- 21 -
25 LC 59 0079
537 (b) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this article shall not restrict

539 (1) Conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or
540 technology;
541 (2) Effectuate a product recall;

543 (4) Authenticate an individual for the purpose of allowing access to a secure location or
544 facility; or
545 (5) Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the
546 consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with
547 the controller or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the
548 provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance
549 of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
550 (c) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this article shall not apply
551 where compliance with this article by the controller or processor would violate an
552 evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state. Nothing in this article shall prevent a
553 controller or processor from providing personal information concerning a consumer to a
554 person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state as part of a
555 privileged communication.
556 (d)(1) A controller or processor that discloses personal information to a third-party
557 controller or processor, in compliance with the requirements of this article, shall not be
558 in violation of this article if:
559 (A) The third-party controller or processor that receives and processes the personal
560 information is in violation of this article; and
561 (B) At the time of disclosing the personal information, the disclosing controller or
562 processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a
563 violation.
S. B. 111
- 22 -
25 LC 59 0079
564 (2) A third-party controller or processor receiving personal information from a controller
565 or processor in compliance with the requirements of this article is likewise not in
566 violation of this article for the violations of the controller or processor from which it
567 receives such personal information.
568 (e) This article shall not impose an obligation on controllers and processors that adversely
569 affects the rights or freedoms of a person, such as exercising the right of free speech
570 pursuant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or that applies to the
571 processing of personal information by a person in the course of a purely personal activity.
572 (f) A controller shall not process personal information for purposes other than those
573 expressly listed in this Code section unless otherwise allowed by this article. Personal
574 information processed by a controller pursuant to this Code section may be processed to
575 the extent that the processing is:
576 (1) Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
577 (2) Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific
578 purposes listed in this section. Personal information collected, used, or retained pursuant
579 to subsection (b) of this Code section shall, where applicable, take into account the nature
580 and purpose or purposes of the collection, use, or retention. The data shall be subject to
581 reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality,

583 foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, use, or retention of
584 personal information.
585 (g) If a controller processes personal information pursuant to an exemption in this Code
586 section, then the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies
587 for the exemption and complies with subsection (f) of this Code section.
588 (h) Processing personal information for the purposes expressly identified in any of the
589 paragraphs (1) through (9) of subsection of (a) of this Code section shall not solely make
590 an entity a controller with respect to the processing.
S. B. 111
- 23 -
25 LC 59 0079
591 10-1-969.
592 Nothing in this article shall be construed to conflict with the specific requirements:
593 (1) Related to the management of health records under Title 31; or
594 (2) Included in federal law.
595 10-1-970.
596 (a) A provision of a contract or agreement that waives or limits a consumer's rights under
597 this article, including, but not limited to, a right to a remedy or means of enforcement, is
598 contrary to public policy, void, and unenforceable.
599 (b) Nothing in this article shall prevent a consumer from declining to request information
600 from a controller, declining to opt out of a controller's sale of the consumer's personal
601 information, or authorizing a controller to sell the consumer's personal information after
602 previously opting out.
603 10-1-971.
604 If the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that an individual, controller, or
605 processor has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in a violation of this article,
606 then the Attorney General may issue a civil investigative demand.
607 10-1-972.
608 (a) The Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to enforce this article.
609 (b) The Attorney General may develop reasonable cause to believe that a controller or
610 processor is in violation of this article, based on the Attorney General's own inquiry or on
611 consumer or public complaints. Prior to initiating an action under this article, the Attorney
612 General shall provide a controller or processor 60 days' written notice identifying the
613 specific provisions of this article the Attorney General alleges have been or are being
614 violated. If within the 60 day period, the controller or processor cures the noticed violation
S. B. 111
- 24 -
25 LC 59 0079
615 and provides the Attorney General an express written statement that the alleged violations
616 have been cured and that no such further violations shall occur, then the Attorney General
617 shall not initiate an action against the controller or processor.
618 (c) If a controller or processor continues to violate this article following the cure period
619 provided for in subsection (b) of this Code section or breaches an express written statement
620 provided to the Attorney General under subsection (b) of this Code section, then the
621 Attorney General may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking any of
622 the following relief:
623 (1) Declaratory judgment that the act or practice violates this article;
624 (2) Injunctive relief, including preliminary and permanent injunctions, to prevent an
625 additional violation of and compel compliance with this article;
626 (3) Civil penalties, as described in subsection (d) of this Code section;
627 (4) Reasonable attorney's fees and investigative costs; or
628 (5) Other relief the court determines appropriate.
629 (d)(1) A court may impose a civil penalty of up to $7,500.00 for each violation of this
630 article.
631 (2) If the court finds the controller or processor willfully or knowingly violated this
632 article, then the court may, in its discretion, award treble damages.
633 (e) A violation of this article shall not serve as the basis for, or be subject to, a private right
634 of action, including a class action lawsuit, under this article or any other law.
635 (f) The Attorney General may recover reasonable expenses incurred in investigating and
636 preparing a case, including attorney's fees, in an action initiated under this article.
637 10-1-973.
638 (a) A controller or processor shall have an affirmative defense to a cause of action for a
639 violation of this article if the controller or processor creates, maintains, and complies with
640 a written privacy program that:
S. B. 111
- 25 -
25 LC 59 0079
641 (1)(A) Reasonably conforms to the NIST or comparable privacy framework designed
642 to safeguard consumer privacy; and
643 (B) Is updated to reasonably conform with a subsequent revision to the NIST or
644 comparable privacy framework within two years of the publication date stated in the
645 most recent revision to the NIST or comparable privacy framework; and
646 (2) Provides a person with the substantive rights required by this article.
647 (b) The scale and scope of a controller or processor's privacy program under subsection (a)
648 of this Code section shall be appropriate if it is based on all of the following factors:
649 (1) The size and complexity of the controller or processor's business;
650 (2) The nature and scope of the activities of the controller or processor;
651 (3) The sensitivity of the personal information processed;
652 (4) The cost and availability of tools to improve privacy protections and data
653 governance; and
654 (5) Compliance with a comparable state or federal law, if applicable.
655 10-1-974.
656 (a) A municipality, county, or consolidated government shall not require a controller or
657 processor to disclose personal information of consumers, unless pursuant to a subpoena or
658 court order.
659 (b) This article shall supersede and preempt any conflicting provisions of any ordinances,
660 resolutions, regulations, or the equivalent adopted by any municipality, county, or
661 consolidated government in this state regarding the processing of personal information by
662 controllers or processors."
663 SECTION 2.
664 This Act shall become effective on July 1, 2026, and shall apply to contracts entered into,
665 amended, or renewed on or after such date.

19 to read as follows:
20 "ARTICLE 37
21 10-1-960.
22 This article shall be known and may be cited as the 'Georgia Consumer Privacy Protection
23 Act.'

279 (D) Obtain a copy of the consumer's personal information that the consumer previously

304 are manifestly unfounded, technically infeasible, excessive, or repetitive, then the
305 controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of
306 complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the
307 burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, technically infeasible, excessive, or
308 repetitive nature of the request; and
309 (4) If a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable
310 efforts, then the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an
311 action under subsection (a) of this Code section and may request that the consumer
312 provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
313 consumer's request.

315 refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's

318 (A) Made available to the consumer in a conspicuous manner;
319 (B) Available at no cost to the consumer; and
320 (C) Similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to
321 subsection (a) of this Code section.
322 (2) Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in
323 writing of action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written
324 explanation of the reasons for the decision. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall
325 then also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method
326 through which the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.

330 reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data is processed, as
331 disclosed to the consumer;
332 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this article, not process personal information for
333 purposes that are beyond what is reasonably necessary to and compatible with the
334 disclosed purposes for which the personal information is processed, as disclosed to the
335 consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;
336 (3) Establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
337 data security practices, as described in Code Section 10-1-973, to protect the

345 unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not discriminate against
346 a consumer for exercising the consumer rights contained in this article, including denying
347 goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing
348 a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer. However, this
349 paragraph shall not require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the
350 personal information of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain, or
351 prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of
352 goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the
353 consumer has exercised the right to opt out pursuant to subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2)
354 of subsection (a) of Code Section 10-1-963 or the offer is related to a consumer's

358 consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child,
359 without processing the data in accordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy
360 Protection Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Section 6501 et seq., and its implementing
361 regulations.

365 (c) A controller shall provide a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice
366 that includes:
367 (1) The categories of personal information processed by the controller;
368 (2) The purpose for processing personal information;
369 (3) How consumers may exercise their consumer rights pursuant to Code
370 Section 10-1-963, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with
371 regard to the consumer's request;
372 (4) The categories of personal information that the controller sells to third parties, if any;
373 and
374 (5) The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller engages in the sale
375 of personal information.
376 (d) If a controller engages in the sale of personal information to third parties or processes
377 personal information for targeted advertising, then the controller shall clearly and
378 conspicuously disclose the processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may
379 exercise the right to opt out of the processing.

382 rights described in Code Section 10-1-963. Such means shall take into account the:
383 (A) Ways in which a consumer normally interacts with the controller;
384 (B) Need for secure and reliable communication of such requests; and
385 (C) Ability of a controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the
386 request.
387 (2) A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise
388 the consumer rights described in Code Section 10-1-963, but may require a consumer to
389 use an existing account.
390 10-1-965.
391 (a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller
392 in meeting its obligations under this article. The assistance provided by the processor shall

394 (1) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the
395 processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as reasonably
396 practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests
397 pursuant to Code Section 10-1-963; and
398 (2) Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document
399 data protection assessments pursuant to Code Section 10-1-966.
400 (b) A contract between a controller and a processor governs the processor's data processing
401 procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract
402 shall be binding and shall clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and
403 purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing,
404 and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements
405 that the processor shall:
S. B. 111
- 16 -

25 LC 59 0079
406 (1) Ensure that each person processing personal information is subject to a duty of
407 confidentiality with respect to the data;
408 (2) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal information to the controller
409 as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal
410 information is required by law;
411 (3) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all
412 information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with
413 the obligations in this article;
414 (4) Allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the
415 controller's designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified
416 and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and
417 technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this article
418 using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment
419 procedure for the assessments. The processor shall provide a report of each assessment
420 to the controller upon request; and
421 (5) Engage a subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in that requires the
422 subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal
423 information.
424 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities
425 imposed on it by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as described in
426 subsection (b) of this Code section.
427 (d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a
428 specific processing of data is a fact based determination that depends upon the context in
429 which personal information is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere to a
430 controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal information
431 remains a processor.

432 10-1-966.
433 (a) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of the
434 following processing activities involving personal information:
435 (1) The processing of personal information for purposes of targeted advertising;
436 (2) The sale of personal information;
437 (3) The processing of personal information for purposes of profiling, where the profiling
438 presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
439 (A) Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;
440 (B) Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;
441 (C) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs
442 or concerns, of consumers, where the intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable
443 person; or
444 (D) Other substantial injury to consumers;
445 (4) The processing of sensitive data; and
446 (5) Processing activities involving personal information that present a heightened risk
447 of harm to consumers.
448 (b) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section
449 shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the
450 processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the
451 potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by
452 safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks. The use of
453 de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of
454 the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose
455 personal information will be processed, shall be factored into this assessment by the
456 controller.
457 (c) The Attorney General may request pursuant to a civil investigative demand that a
458 controller disclose a data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation
S. B. 111

25 LC 59 0079
459 conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection
460 assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall evaluate the data
461 protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in Code
462 Section 10-1-964. The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request
463 from the Attorney General shall not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work
464 product protection with respect to the assessment and information contained in the
465 assessment. Such data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall not be open
466 to public inspection and copying under Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50, relating to open
467 records.
468 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing
469 operations that include similar activities.
470 (e) A data protection assessment conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance
471 with other laws, rules, or regulations may comply with this Code section if such data
472 protection assessment have a reasonably comparable scope and effect.
473 (f) The data protection assessment requirements in this article shall apply only to
474 processing activities created or generated on or after July 1, 2026.
475 10-1-967.
476 (a) A controller in possession of de-identified data shall:
477 (1) Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with a natural
478 person;
479 (2) Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to
480 reidentify the data; and
481 (3) Contractually obligate recipients of the de-identified data to comply with this article.
482 (b) Nothing in this Code section shall require a controller or processor to:
483 (1) Reidentify de-identified data or pseudonymous data;
S. B. 111
- 19 -

25 LC 59 0079
484 (2) Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access data or
485 technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with
486 personal information; or
487 (3) Comply with an authenticated consumer rights request, pursuant to Code
488 Section 10-1-963, if:
489 (A) The controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the
490 personal information or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to
491 associate the request with the personal information;
492 (B) The controller does not use the personal information to recognize or respond to the
493 specific consumer who is the subject of the personal information, or associate the
494 personal information with other personal information about the same specific
495 consumer; and
496 (C) The controller does not engage in the sale of personal information to a third party
497 or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal information to a third party other than a
498 processor, except as otherwise permitted in this Code section.
499 (c) The consumer rights described in Code Sections 10-1-963 and 10-1-964 shall not apply
500 to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to demonstrate information
501 necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical
502 and organizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing that information.
503 (d) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall exercise
504 reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with contractual commitments to which the
505 pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to
506 address breaches of those contractual commitments.
507 10-1-968.
508 (a) Nothing in this article shall restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:

518 including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty, or take steps at the request of the
519 consumer prior to entering into a contract;
520 (6) Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical
521 safety of the consumer or of another natural person, and where the processing cannot be
522 manifestly based on another legal basis;
523 (7) Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud,
524 harassment, malicious or deceptive activity, or illegal activity; preserve the integrity or
525 security of systems; or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for such action;
526 (8) Engage in public reviewed or peer reviewed scientific or statistical research in the
527 public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is
528 approved, monitored, and governed by an institutional review board, or similar
529 independent oversight entity that determines whether:
530 (A) Deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not
531 exclusively accrue to the controller;
532 (B) The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
533 (C) The controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks
534 associated with research, including risks associated with reidentification; or
535 (9) Assist another controller, processor, or third party with the obligations under this
536 article.

25 LC 59 0079
537 (b) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this article shall not restrict

547 the controller or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the
548 provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance
549 of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
550 (c) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this article shall not apply
551 where compliance with this article by the controller or processor would violate an
552 evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state. Nothing in this article shall prevent a
553 controller or processor from providing personal information concerning a consumer to a
554 person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state as part of a
555 privileged communication.
556 (d)(1) A controller or processor that discloses personal information to a third-party
557 controller or processor, in compliance with the requirements of this article, shall not be
558 in violation of this article if:
559 (A) The third-party controller or processor that receives and processes the personal
560 information is in violation of this article; and
561 (B) At the time of disclosing the personal information, the disclosing controller or
562 processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a
563 violation.

25 LC 59 0079
564 (2) A third-party controller or processor receiving personal information from a controller
565 or processor in compliance with the requirements of this article is likewise not in
566 violation of this article for the violations of the controller or processor from which it
567 receives such personal information.
568 (e) This article shall not impose an obligation on controllers and processors that adversely
569 affects the rights or freedoms of a person, such as exercising the right of free speech
570 pursuant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or that applies to the
571 processing of personal information by a person in the course of a purely personal activity.
572 (f) A controller shall not process personal information for purposes other than those
573 expressly listed in this Code section unless otherwise allowed by this article. Personal
574 information processed by a controller pursuant to this Code section may be processed to
575 the extent that the processing is:
576 (1) Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
577 (2) Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific
578 purposes listed in this section. Personal information collected, used, or retained pursuant
579 to subsection (b) of this Code section shall, where applicable, take into account the nature
580 and purpose or purposes of the collection, use, or retention. The data shall be subject to
581 reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality,

583 foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, use, or retention of
584 personal information.
585 (g) If a controller processes personal information pursuant to an exemption in this Code
586 section, then the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies
587 for the exemption and complies with subsection (f) of this Code section.
588 (h) Processing personal information for the purposes expressly identified in any of the
589 paragraphs (1) through (9) of subsection of (a) of this Code section shall not solely make
590 an entity a controller with respect to the processing.

593 (1) Related to the management of health records under Title 31; or
594 (2) Included in federal law.
595 10-1-970.
596 (a) A provision of a contract or agreement that waives or limits a consumer's rights under
597 this article, including, but not limited to, a right to a remedy or means of enforcement, is
598 contrary to public policy, void, and unenforceable.
599 (b) Nothing in this article shall prevent a consumer from declining to request information
600 from a controller, declining to opt out of a controller's sale of the consumer's personal
601 information, or authorizing a controller to sell the consumer's personal information after
602 previously opting out.
603 10-1-971.
604 If the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that an individual, controller, or
605 processor has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in a violation of this article,
606 then the Attorney General may issue a civil investigative demand.
607 10-1-972.
608 (a) The Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to enforce this article.
609 (b) The Attorney General may develop reasonable cause to believe that a controller or
610 processor is in violation of this article, based on the Attorney General's own inquiry or on

612 General shall provide a controller or processor 60 days' written notice identifying the
613 specific provisions of this article the Attorney General alleges have been or are being
614 violated. If within the 60 day period, the controller or processor cures the noticed violation

- 24 -

25 LC 59 0079
615 and provides the Attorney General an express written statement that the alleged violations
616 have been cured and that no such further violations shall occur, then the Attorney General
617 shall not initiate an action against the controller or processor.
618 (c) If a controller or processor continues to violate this article following the cure period
619 provided for in subsection (b) of this Code section or breaches an express written statement
620 provided to the Attorney General under subsection (b) of this Code section, then the
621 Attorney General may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking any of
622 the following relief:
623 (1) Declaratory judgment that the act or practice violates this article;
624 (2) Injunctive relief, including preliminary and permanent injunctions, to prevent an
625 additional violation of and compel compliance with this article;

627 (4) Reasonable attorney's fees and investigative costs; or
628 (5) Other relief the court determines appropriate.
629 (d)(1) A court may impose a civil penalty of up to $7,500.00 for each violation of this
630 article.
631 (2) If the court finds the controller or processor willfully or knowingly violated this
632 article, then the court may, in its discretion, award treble damages.

636 preparing a case, including attorney's fees, in an action initiated under this article.
637 10-1-973.

639 violation of this article if the controller or processor creates, maintains, and complies with
640 a written privacy program that:
S. B. 111
- 25 -

25 LC 59 0079
641 (1)(A) Reasonably conforms to the NIST or comparable privacy framework designed
642 to safeguard consumer privacy; and
643 (B) Is updated to reasonably conform with a subsequent revision to the NIST or
644 comparable privacy framework within two years of the publication date stated in the
645 most recent revision to the NIST or comparable privacy framework; and
646 (2) Provides a person with the substantive rights required by this article.
647 (b) The scale and scope of a controller or processor's privacy program under subsection (a)
648 of this Code section shall be appropriate if it is based on all of the following factors:
649 (1) The size and complexity of the controller or processor's business;
650 (2) The nature and scope of the activities of the controller or processor;
651 (3) The sensitivity of the personal information processed;
652 (4) The cost and availability of tools to improve privacy protections and data
653 governance; and
654 (5) Compliance with a comparable state or federal law, if applicable.
655 10-1-974.
656 (a) A municipality, county, or consolidated government shall not require a controller or
657 processor to disclose personal information of consumers, unless pursuant to a subpoena or
658 court order.
659 (b) This article shall supersede and preempt any conflicting provisions of any ordinances,
660 resolutions, regulations, or the equivalent adopted by any municipality, county, or
661 consolidated government in this state regarding the processing of personal information by
662 controllers or processors."
