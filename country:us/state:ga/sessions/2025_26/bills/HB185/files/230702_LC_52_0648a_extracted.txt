860 State by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure

871 Home States during the course of the investigations. The Home State shall also have

886 furtherance of any joint investigation initiated under the Compact.

888 resulting in an Encumbrance on the Home State License, the Licensee's Compact
H. B. 185
- 35 -
25 LC 52 0648
889 Privilege(s) in all other Member States shall be revoked until all Encumbrances have been
890 removed from the Home State License. All Home State disciplinary orders that impose
891 Adverse Action against a Licensee shall include a statement that the Licensee's Compact
892 Privileges are revoked in all Member States during the pendency of the order.
893 I. Once an Encumbered License in the Home State is restored to an Unencumbered
894 License (as certified by the Home State's Licensing Authority), the Licensee must meet the
895 requirements of Section 4(A) and follow the administrative requirements to reapply to
896 obtain a Compact Privilege in any Remote State.
897 J. If a Member State takes Adverse Action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the
898 Data System. The administrator of the Data System shall promptly notify the other
899 Member States State of any Adverse Actions.
900 K. Nothing in this Compact shall override a Member State's decision that participation in

1157 SECTION 10. RULEMAKING
1158 A. The Compact Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively
1159 and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the Compact. A
1160 Rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction
1161 holds that the Rule is invalid because the Compact Commission exercised its rulemaking
1162 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers
1163 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
1164 B. The Rules of the Compact Commission shall have the force of law in each Member
1165 State, provided however that where the Rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a
1166 Member State that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a Licensed Dietitian is
1167 permitted to undertake in that State and the circumstances under which they may do so, as
1168 held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Compact Commission shall be
1169 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
1170 C. The Compact Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria
1171 set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on
1172 the day following adoption or as of the date specified in the Rule or amendment, whichever
1173 is later.
1174 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule,
1175 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact
H. B. 185
- 46 -
25 LC 52 0648
1176 within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no
1177 further force and effect in any Member State.
1178 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Compact Commission.
1179 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Compact Commission shall hold a public
1180 hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and
1181 arguments.
1182 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Compact Commission, and at least
1183 thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the Compact Commission will hold a

1185 Proposed rulemaking:
1186 1. On the website of the Compact Commission or other publicly accessible platform;
1187 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Compact Commission's notices of
1188 proposed rulemaking; and
1189 3. In such other way(s) as the Compact Commission may by Rule specify.
1190 H. The Notice of Proposed rulemaking shall include:
1191 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the Compact Commission
1192 will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if different, the time, date, and
1193 location of the meeting where the Compact Commission will consider and vote on the
1194 proposed Rule;
1195 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of
1196 communication, the Compact Commission shall include the mechanism for access to the
1197 hearing in the Notice of Proposed rulemaking;
1198 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefore;
1199 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person; and
1200 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
H. B. 185
- 47 -
25 LC 52 0648
1201 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and
1202 documents received by the Compact Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall
1203 be available to the public.
1204 J. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule.
1205 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Compact Commission at hearings
1206 required by this Section.
1207 K. The Compact Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on
1208 the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.
1209 1. The Compact Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the
1210 changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
1211 2. The Compact Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive
1212 changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made
1213 that were recommended by commenters.
1214 3. The Compact Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the Rule.
1215 Except for an emergency as provided in Section 10(L), the effective date of the Rule shall
1216 be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
1217 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Compact Commission may consider
1218 and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided
1219 that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this Section shall be
1220 retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
1221 ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
1222 emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
1223 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
1224 2. Prevent a loss of Compact Commission or Member State funds;
1225 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is established by federal law or
1226 rule; or
1227 4. Protect public health and safety.

1228 M. The Compact Commission or an authorized committee of the Compact Commission
1229 may direct revision to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting typographical
1230 errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
1231 revision shall be posted on the website of the Compact Commission. The revision shall be
1232 subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The
1233 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change
1234 to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Compact Commission
1235 prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect
1236 without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
1237 without the approval of the Compact Commission.
1238 N. No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.
1239 SECTION 11. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
1240 A. Oversight
1241 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in each Member State shall
1242 enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this
1243 Compact.
1244 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is proper and judicial
1245 proceedings by or against the Compact Commission shall be brought solely and
1246 exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Compact
1247 Commission is located. The Compact Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
1248 defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
1249 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
1250 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such
1251 similar matter.
1252 3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
1253 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have
H. B. 185
- 49 -
25 LC 52 0648
1254 standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
1255 Compact Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
1256 Compact Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
1257 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
1258 1. If the Compact Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the
1259 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated
1260 Rules, the Compact Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The
1261 notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and
1262 any other action that the Compact Commission may take and shall offer training and
1263 specific technical assistance regarding the default.
1264 2. The Compact Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other
1265 Member States.
1266 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from
1267 the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member States,
1268 and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
1269 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
1270 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
1271 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means
1272 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall
1273 be given by the Compact Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders
1274 of the defaulting State's legislature, the defaulting State's Licensing Authority, and each of
1275 the Member States' Licensing Authority.
1276 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
1277 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
1278 extend beyond the effective date of termination.
1279 F. Upon the termination of a State's membership from this Compact, that State shall
1280 immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that State of such termination. The
H. B. 185
- 50 -
25 LC 52 0648
1281 terminated State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this
1282 Compact for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of termination.
1283 G. The Compact Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be
1284 in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing
1285 between the Compact Commission and the defaulting State.
1286 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Compact Commission by petitioning
1287 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
1288 Compact Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all
1289 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
1290 I. Dispute Resolution
1291 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Compact Commission shall attempt to resolve
1292 disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between Member
1293 and non-Member States.
1294 2. The Compact Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and
1295 binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
1296 J. Enforcement
1297 1. By supermajority vote, the Compact Commission may initiate legal action against a
1298 Member State in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
1299 or the federal district where the Compact Commission has its principal offices to enforce
1300 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief
1301 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
1302 is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
1303 reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
1304 Compact Commission. The Compact Commission may pursue any other remedies
1305 available under federal or the defaulting Member State's law.
1306 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Compact Commission in the U.S.
1307 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Compact
H. B. 185
- 51 -
25 LC 52 0648
1308 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
1309 Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
1310 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall
1311 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
1312 3. No party other than a Member State shall enforce this Compact against the Compact
1313 Commission.

1317 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Compact Commission shall convene
1318 and review the enactment of each of the first seven Member States ("Charter Member
1319 States") to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is
1320 materially different than the model Compact statute.
1321 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from
1322 the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in
1323 Section 11.
1324 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws
1325 from the Compact, the Compact Commission shall remain in existence and the
1326 Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member States should be less than
1327 seven.
1328 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven initial Charter Member
1329 States shall be subject to the process set forth in Section 8(C)(21) to determine if their
1330 enactments are materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they
1331 qualify for participation in the Compact.
1332 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Compact Commission or in furtherance of the
1333 purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact
H. B. 185
- 52 -
25 LC 52 0648
1334 or the Compact Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of
1335 the Compact Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Compact Commission.
1336 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Compact Commission's initial
1337 adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist
1338 on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been
1339 previously adopted by the Compact Commission shall have the full force and effect of
1340 law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.
1341 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing
1342 the same.
1343 1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of
1344 the repealing statute.
1345 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's
1346 Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting
1347 requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
1348 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a State shall
1349 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State.
1350 Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
1351 State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this Compact
1352 for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
1353 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
1354 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a
1355 non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
1356 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact
1357 shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws
1358 of all Member States.

1359 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
1360 A. This Compact and the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally
1361 construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the
1362 Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation
1363 of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority
1364 solely for those purposes.
1365 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence,
1366 or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
1367 the constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of
1368 the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or
1369 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
1370 of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
1371 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
1372 C. Notwithstanding Section 13(B), the Compact Commission may deny a State's
1373 participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 11(B),
1374 terminate a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it determines that a
1375 constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the Compact.
1376 Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
1377 State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States
1378 and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.
1379 SECTION 14. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
1380 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a Member
1381 State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
1382 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a Member State in
1383 conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

1067 Compact Privilege to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Compact
1068 Commission and its staff, which must, in a total amount, be sufficient to cover its annual
1069 budget as approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources. The
1070 aggregate annual assessment amount for Member States shall be allocated based upon a
1071 formula that the Compact Commission shall promulgate by Rule.

1087 omission that occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a

1106 amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out of any
1107 actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Compact
1108 Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable
1109 basis for believing occurred within the scope of Compact Commission employment,
1110 duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did
1111 not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.

1113 professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other
1114 applicable State laws.
1115 5. Nothing in this Compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a Member

1157 SECTION 10. RULEMAKING
1158 A. The Compact Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively
1159 and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the Compact. A
1160 Rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction
1161 holds that the Rule is invalid because the Compact Commission exercised its rulemaking
1162 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers
1163 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
1164 B. The Rules of the Compact Commission shall have the force of law in each Member
1165 State, provided however that where the Rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a
1166 Member State that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a Licensed Dietitian is
1167 permitted to undertake in that State and the circumstances under which they may do so, as
1168 held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Compact Commission shall be
1169 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
1170 C. The Compact Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria
1171 set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on
1172 the day following adoption or as of the date specified in the Rule or amendment, whichever

1174 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule,
1175 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact
H. B. 185
- 46 -

25 LC 52 0648

1194 proposed Rule;
1195 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of

1197 hearing in the Notice of Proposed rulemaking;
1198 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefore;
1199 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person; and
1200 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.

1202 documents received by the Compact Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall
1203 be available to the public.
1204 J. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule.
1205 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Compact Commission at hearings
1206 required by this Section.

1208 the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.
1209 1. The Compact Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the
1210 changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
1211 2. The Compact Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive
1212 changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made
1213 that were recommended by commenters.

1215 Except for an emergency as provided in Section 10(L), the effective date of the Rule shall
1216 be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
1217 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Compact Commission may consider
1218 and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided
1219 that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this Section shall be
1220 retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
1221 ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
1222 emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
1223 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
1224 2. Prevent a loss of Compact Commission or Member State funds;
1225 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is established by federal law or
1226 rule; or
1227 4. Protect public health and safety.

1228 M. The Compact Commission or an authorized committee of the Compact Commission
1229 may direct revision to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting typographical
1230 errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
1231 revision shall be posted on the website of the Compact Commission. The revision shall be
1232 subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The
1233 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change
1234 to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Compact Commission
1235 prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect
1236 without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
1237 without the approval of the Compact Commission.
1238 N. No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.
1239 SECTION 11. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
1240 A. Oversight
1241 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in each Member State shall
1242 enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this
1243 Compact.
1244 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is proper and judicial
1245 proceedings by or against the Compact Commission shall be brought solely and
1246 exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Compact
1247 Commission is located. The Compact Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
1248 defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
1249 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
1250 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such
1251 similar matter.
1252 3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
1253 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have
H. B. 185
- 49 -

25 LC 52 0648
1254 standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
1255 Compact Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
1256 Compact Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
1257 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
1258 1. If the Compact Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the
1259 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated
1260 Rules, the Compact Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The
1261 notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and
1262 any other action that the Compact Commission may take and shall offer training and
1263 specific technical assistance regarding the default.
1264 2. The Compact Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other
1265 Member States.
1266 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from
1267 the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member States,
1268 and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
1269 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
1270 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
1271 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means
1272 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall
1273 be given by the Compact Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders
1274 of the defaulting State's legislature, the defaulting State's Licensing Authority, and each of
1275 the Member States' Licensing Authority.
1276 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
1277 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
1278 extend beyond the effective date of termination.
1279 F. Upon the termination of a State's membership from this Compact, that State shall
1280 immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that State of such termination. The
H. B. 185
- 50 -

25 LC 52 0648
1281 terminated State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this
1282 Compact for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of termination.
1283 G. The Compact Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be
1284 in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing
1285 between the Compact Commission and the defaulting State.
1286 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Compact Commission by petitioning
1287 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
1288 Compact Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all
1289 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
1290 I. Dispute Resolution
1291 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Compact Commission shall attempt to resolve
1292 disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between Member
1293 and non-Member States.
1294 2. The Compact Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and
1295 binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
1296 J. Enforcement
1297 1. By supermajority vote, the Compact Commission may initiate legal action against a
1298 Member State in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
1299 or the federal district where the Compact Commission has its principal offices to enforce
1300 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief
1301 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
1302 is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
1303 reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
1304 Compact Commission. The Compact Commission may pursue any other remedies
1305 available under federal or the defaulting Member State's law.
1306 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Compact Commission in the U.S.
1307 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Compact
H. B. 185
- 51 -

25 LC 52 0648
1308 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
1309 Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
1310 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall
1311 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
1312 3. No party other than a Member State shall enforce this Compact against the Compact
1313 Commission.
1314 SECTION 12. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
1315 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is
1316 enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
1317 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Compact Commission shall convene
1318 and review the enactment of each of the first seven Member States ("Charter Member
1319 States") to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is
1320 materially different than the model Compact statute.
1321 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from
1322 the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in
1323 Section 11.
1324 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws
1325 from the Compact, the Compact Commission shall remain in existence and the
1326 Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member States should be less than
1327 seven.
1328 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven initial Charter Member
1329 States shall be subject to the process set forth in Section 8(C)(21) to determine if their
1330 enactments are materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they
1331 qualify for participation in the Compact.
1332 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Compact Commission or in furtherance of the
1333 purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact
H. B. 185
- 52 -

25 LC 52 0648
1334 or the Compact Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of
1335 the Compact Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Compact Commission.
1336 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Compact Commission's initial
1337 adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist
1338 on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been
1339 previously adopted by the Compact Commission shall have the full force and effect of
1340 law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.
1341 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing
1342 the same.
1343 1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of
1344 the repealing statute.
1345 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's
1346 Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting
1347 requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
1348 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a State shall
1349 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State.
1350 Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
1351 State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this Compact
1352 for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
1353 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
1354 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a
1355 non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
1356 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact
1357 shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws
1358 of all Member States.

1359 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
1360 A. This Compact and the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally
1361 construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the
1362 Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation
1363 of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority
1364 solely for those purposes.
1365 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence,
1366 or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
1367 the constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of
1368 the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or
1369 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
1370 of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
1371 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
1372 C. Notwithstanding Section 13(B), the Compact Commission may deny a State's
1373 participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 11(B),
1374 terminate a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it determines that a
1375 constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the Compact.
1376 Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
1377 State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States
1378 and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.
1379 SECTION 14. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
1380 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a Member
1381 State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
1382 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a Member State in
1383 conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
