883 furtherance of any joint investigation initiated under the Compact.

885 resulting in an Encumbrance on the Home State License, the Licensee's Compact
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 35 -
25 LC 52 0820S

887 removed from the Home State License. All Home State disciplinary orders that impose
888 Adverse Action against a Licensee shall include a statement that the Licensee's Compact
889 Privileges are revoked in all Member States during the pendency of the order.
890 I. Once an Encumbered License in the Home State is restored to an Unencumbered
891 License (as certified by the Home State's Licensing Authority), the Licensee must meet the
892 requirements of Section 4(A) and follow the administrative requirements to reapply to
893 obtain a Compact Privilege in any Remote State.
894 J. If a Member State takes Adverse Action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the
895 Data System. The administrator of the Data System shall promptly notify the other
896 Member States State of any Adverse Actions.

1154 SECTION 10. RULEMAKING
1155 A. The Compact Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively
1156 and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the Compact. A
1157 Rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction
1158 holds that the Rule is invalid because the Compact Commission exercised its rulemaking
1159 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers
1160 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
1161 B. The Rules of the Compact Commission shall have the force of law in each Member
1162 State, provided however that where the Rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a
1163 Member State that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a Licensed Dietitian is
1164 permitted to undertake in that State and the circumstances under which they may do so, as
1165 held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Compact Commission shall be
1166 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
1167 C. The Compact Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria
1168 set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on
1169 the day following adoption or as of the date specified in the Rule or amendment, whichever
1170 is later.
1171 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule,
1172 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 46 -
25 LC 52 0820S

1189 will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if different, the time, date, and
1190 location of the meeting where the Compact Commission will consider and vote on the
1191 proposed Rule;
1192 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of
1193 communication, the Compact Commission shall include the mechanism for access to the
1194 hearing in the Notice of Proposed rulemaking;
1195 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefore;
1196 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person; and
1197 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.

1199 documents received by the Compact Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall
1200 be available to the public.
1201 J. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule.
1202 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Compact Commission at hearings

1205 the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.
1206 1. The Compact Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the
1207 changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
1208 2. The Compact Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive
1209 changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made

1212 Except for an emergency as provided in Section 10(L), the effective date of the Rule shall
1213 be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
1214 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Compact Commission may consider
1215 and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided
1216 that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this Section shall be
1217 retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
1218 ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
1219 emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
1220 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
1221 2. Prevent a loss of Compact Commission or Member State funds;
1222 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is established by federal law or
1223 rule; or
1224 4. Protect public health and safety.

1225 M. The Compact Commission or an authorized committee of the Compact Commission
1226 may direct revision to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting typographical
1227 errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
1228 revision shall be posted on the website of the Compact Commission. The revision shall be
1229 subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The
1230 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change
1231 to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Compact Commission
1232 prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect
1233 without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
1234 without the approval of the Compact Commission.
1235 N. No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.
1236 SECTION 11. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
1237 A. Oversight
1238 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in each Member State shall
1239 enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this
1240 Compact.
1241 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is proper and judicial
1242 proceedings by or against the Compact Commission shall be brought solely and
1243 exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Compact
1244 Commission is located. The Compact Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
1245 defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
1246 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
1247 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such
1248 similar matter.
1249 3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
1250 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 49 -
25 LC 52 0820S
1251 standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
1252 Compact Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
1253 Compact Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
1254 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
1255 1. If the Compact Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the
1256 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated
1257 Rules, the Compact Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The
1258 notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and
1259 any other action that the Compact Commission may take and shall offer training and
1260 specific technical assistance regarding the default.
1261 2. The Compact Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other
1262 Member States.
1263 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from
1264 the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member States,
1265 and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
1266 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
1267 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
1268 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means
1269 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall
1270 be given by the Compact Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders
1271 of the defaulting State's legislature, the defaulting State's Licensing Authority, and each of
1272 the Member States' Licensing Authority.
1273 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
1274 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
1275 extend beyond the effective date of termination.
1276 F. Upon the termination of a State's membership from this Compact, that State shall
1277 immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that State of such termination. The
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 50 -
25 LC 52 0820S
1278 terminated State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this
1279 Compact for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of termination.
1280 G. The Compact Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be
1281 in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing
1282 between the Compact Commission and the defaulting State.
1283 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Compact Commission by petitioning
1284 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
1285 Compact Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all
1286 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
1287 I. Dispute Resolution
1288 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Compact Commission shall attempt to resolve
1289 disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between Member
1290 and non-Member States.
1291 2. The Compact Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and
1292 binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
1293 J. Enforcement
1294 1. By supermajority vote, the Compact Commission may initiate legal action against a
1295 Member State in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
1296 or the federal district where the Compact Commission has its principal offices to enforce
1297 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief
1298 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
1299 is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
1300 reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
1301 Compact Commission. The Compact Commission may pursue any other remedies
1302 available under federal or the defaulting Member State's law.
1303 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Compact Commission in the U.S.
1304 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Compact
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 51 -
25 LC 52 0820S
1305 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
1306 Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
1307 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall
1308 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
1309 3. No party other than a Member State shall enforce this Compact against the Compact
1310 Commission.

1317 materially different than the model Compact statute.
1318 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from
1319 the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in

1325 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven initial Charter Member
1326 States shall be subject to the process set forth in Section 8(C)(21) to determine if their
1327 enactments are materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they
1328 qualify for participation in the Compact.

1330 purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact
H. B. 185 (SUB)

25 LC 52 0820S
1331 or the Compact Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of
1332 the Compact Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Compact Commission.
1333 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Compact Commission's initial
1334 adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist
1335 on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been
1336 previously adopted by the Compact Commission shall have the full force and effect of
1337 law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.

1339 the same.
1340 1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of
1341 the repealing statute.
1342 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's
1343 Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting
1344 requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
1345 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a State shall
1346 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State.

1348 State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this Compact
1349 for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
1350 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
1351 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a
1352 non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
1353 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact
1354 shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws
1355 of all Member States.

1356 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
1357 A. This Compact and the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally
1358 construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the
1359 Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation
1360 of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority
1361 solely for those purposes.
1362 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence,
1363 or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to

1365 the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or
1366 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity

1368 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
1369 C. Notwithstanding Section 13(B), the Compact Commission may deny a State's
1370 participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 11(B),
1371 terminate a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it determines that a
1372 constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the Compact.
1373 Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
1374 State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States
1375 and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.
1376 SECTION 14. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
1377 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a Member
1378 State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.

1067 aggregate annual assessment amount for Member States shall be allocated based upon a
1068 formula that the Compact Commission shall promulgate by Rule.

1105 Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable
1106 basis for believing occurred within the scope of Compact Commission employment,
1107 duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did
1108 not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.

1110 professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other
1111 applicable State laws.
1112 5. Nothing in this Compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a Member

1114 claims under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other State or federal antitrust or
1115 anticompetitive law or regulation.
1116 6. Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity by

1154 SECTION 10. RULEMAKING
1155 A. The Compact Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to effectively
1156 and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the Compact. A
1157 Rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction
1158 holds that the Rule is invalid because the Compact Commission exercised its rulemaking
1159 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers
1160 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
1161 B. The Rules of the Compact Commission shall have the force of law in each Member
1162 State, provided however that where the Rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a
1163 Member State that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a Licensed Dietitian is
1164 permitted to undertake in that State and the circumstances under which they may do so, as
1165 held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Compact Commission shall be
1166 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
1167 C. The Compact Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria
1168 set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on

1171 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule,
1172 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 46 -

25 LC 52 0820S

1191 proposed Rule;
1192 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of
1193 communication, the Compact Commission shall include the mechanism for access to the
1194 hearing in the Notice of Proposed rulemaking;
1195 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefore;
1196 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person; and
1197 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.

1199 documents received by the Compact Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall
1200 be available to the public.
1201 J. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule.
1202 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Compact Commission at hearings
1203 required by this Section.

1205 the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.
1206 1. The Compact Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the
1207 changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.
1208 2. The Compact Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive
1209 changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made
1210 that were recommended by commenters.

1212 Except for an emergency as provided in Section 10(L), the effective date of the Rule shall
1213 be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
1214 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Compact Commission may consider
1215 and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided
1216 that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this Section shall be
1217 retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
1218 ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
1219 emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
1220 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
1221 2. Prevent a loss of Compact Commission or Member State funds;
1222 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is established by federal law or
1223 rule; or
1224 4. Protect public health and safety.

1225 M. The Compact Commission or an authorized committee of the Compact Commission
1226 may direct revision to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting typographical
1227 errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
1228 revision shall be posted on the website of the Compact Commission. The revision shall be
1229 subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The
1230 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change
1231 to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Compact Commission
1232 prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect
1233 without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
1234 without the approval of the Compact Commission.
1235 N. No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.
1236 SECTION 11. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
1237 A. Oversight
1238 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in each Member State shall
1239 enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this
1240 Compact.
1241 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is proper and judicial
1242 proceedings by or against the Compact Commission shall be brought solely and
1243 exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Compact
1244 Commission is located. The Compact Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
1245 defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
1246 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
1247 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such
1248 similar matter.
1249 3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
1250 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 49 -

25 LC 52 0820S
1251 standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
1252 Compact Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
1253 Compact Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
1254 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
1255 1. If the Compact Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the
1256 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated
1257 Rules, the Compact Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The
1258 notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and
1259 any other action that the Compact Commission may take and shall offer training and
1260 specific technical assistance regarding the default.
1261 2. The Compact Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other
1262 Member States.
1263 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from
1264 the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member States,
1265 and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
1266 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
1267 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
1268 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means
1269 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall
1270 be given by the Compact Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders
1271 of the defaulting State's legislature, the defaulting State's Licensing Authority, and each of
1272 the Member States' Licensing Authority.
1273 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
1274 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
1275 extend beyond the effective date of termination.
1276 F. Upon the termination of a State's membership from this Compact, that State shall
1277 immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that State of such termination. The
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 50 -

25 LC 52 0820S
1278 terminated State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this
1279 Compact for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of termination.
1280 G. The Compact Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be
1281 in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing
1282 between the Compact Commission and the defaulting State.
1283 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Compact Commission by petitioning
1284 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
1285 Compact Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all
1286 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
1287 I. Dispute Resolution
1288 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Compact Commission shall attempt to resolve
1289 disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between Member
1290 and non-Member States.
1291 2. The Compact Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and
1292 binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
1293 J. Enforcement
1294 1. By supermajority vote, the Compact Commission may initiate legal action against a
1295 Member State in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
1296 or the federal district where the Compact Commission has its principal offices to enforce
1297 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief
1298 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
1299 is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
1300 reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
1301 Compact Commission. The Compact Commission may pursue any other remedies
1302 available under federal or the defaulting Member State's law.
1303 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Compact Commission in the U.S.
1304 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Compact
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 51 -

25 LC 52 0820S
1305 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
1306 Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
1307 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall
1308 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
1309 3. No party other than a Member State shall enforce this Compact against the Compact
1310 Commission.
1311 SECTION 12. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
1312 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is
1313 enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
1314 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Compact Commission shall convene
1315 and review the enactment of each of the first seven Member States ("Charter Member
1316 States") to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is
1317 materially different than the model Compact statute.
1318 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be materially different from
1319 the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in
1320 Section 11.
1321 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws
1322 from the Compact, the Compact Commission shall remain in existence and the
1323 Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member States should be less than
1324 seven.
1325 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven initial Charter Member
1326 States shall be subject to the process set forth in Section 8(C)(21) to determine if their
1327 enactments are materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they
1328 qualify for participation in the Compact.
1329 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Compact Commission or in furtherance of the
1330 purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact
H. B. 185 (SUB)
- 52 -

25 LC 52 0820S
1331 or the Compact Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of
1332 the Compact Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Compact Commission.
1333 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Compact Commission's initial
1334 adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist
1335 on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been
1336 previously adopted by the Compact Commission shall have the full force and effect of
1337 law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.
1338 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing
1339 the same.
1340 1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of
1341 the repealing statute.
1342 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's
1343 Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting
1344 requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
1345 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a State shall
1346 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State.
1347 Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
1348 State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this Compact
1349 for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
1350 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
1351 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a
1352 non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
1353 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact
1354 shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws
1355 of all Member States.

1356 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
1357 A. This Compact and the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally
1358 construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the
1359 Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation
1360 of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Compact Commission's rulemaking authority
1361 solely for those purposes.
1362 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence,
1363 or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
1364 the constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of
1365 the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or
1366 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
1367 of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
1368 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
1369 C. Notwithstanding Section 13(B), the Compact Commission may deny a State's
1370 participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 11(B),
1371 terminate a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it determines that a
1372 constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the Compact.
1373 Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
1374 State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States
1375 and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.
1376 SECTION 14. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
1377 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a Member
1378 State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
1379 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a Member State in
1380 conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
