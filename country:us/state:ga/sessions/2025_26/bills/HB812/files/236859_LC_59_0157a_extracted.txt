17 the state minimum standard codes do not meet its needs, the local government may
18 provide requirements not less stringent than those specified in the state minimum
19 standard codes when such requirements are based on local climatic, geologic,
20 topographic, or public safety factors; provided, however, that there is a determination by
21 the local governing body of a need to amend the requirements of the state minimum
22 standard code based upon a demonstration by the local governing body that local
23 conditions justify such requirements not less stringent than those specified in the state
24 minimum standard codes for the protection of life and property. All such proposed
25 amendments shall be submitted by the local governing body to the department 60 days
26 prior to the adoption of such amendment. Concurrent with the submission of the

35 show that local climatic, geologic, topographic, or public safety factors require such an
36 amendment; or
37 (B) The That the proposed local amendment should may be adopted, due to a
38 preponderance of evidence that such proposed local amendment would be as stringent
39 as the state minimum standard codes and a preponderance of evidence that the local
40 climatic, geologic, topographic, or public safety factors require such an amendment; or
41 (C) That the department has no recommendation regarding the adoption or disapproval
42 of the proposed local amendments, due to the lack of sufficient evidence to show that
H. B. 812
- 2 -
25 LC 59 0157
43 such proposed local amendment would or would not be as stringent as the state
44 minimum standard codes and the lack of sufficient evidence to show that local climatic,
45 geologic, topographic, or public safety factors require or do not require such an
46 amendment.
47 (2) The department shall have 60 days after receipt of a proposed local amendment to
48 review the proposed amendment and make a recommendation as set forth in
49 paragraph (1) of this subsection. In the event that the department fails to respond within
50 the time allotted, the local governing body may adopt the proposed local amendment.

52 local amendment, a local governing body shall specifically vote to reject the department's
53 recommendations before any local amendment may be adopted.

62 standard codes adopted by the various municipalities and counties in the this state, which
63 information shall be made available to the public upon request. The department may
64 charge reasonable fees for copies of such information. An index of such amendments
65 shall be included in each new edition of a state minimum standard code.
66 (7)(5) At the time of issuing a building permit, the issuing county or municipality shall
67 notify the holder of the permit of any local amendments to the state minimum standard
68 codes which are in effect for that county or municipality and that any such amendments

114 denial or nonacceptance, the local issuing authority shall provide the applicant with a
115 written list of the reasons for such denial or nonacceptance and a citation to the local, state,
116 or federal law supporting each reason for the denial or nonacceptance. Should the
117 applicant make material additions to the resubmitted application that are unrelated to the
118 cited reasons for the denial or nonacceptance of the original application, the local issuing
119 authority may also address such additions in reviewing the resubmitted application. Any
120 land-disturbing activity permitted under this chapter shall be carried out in accordance with
121 this chapter and the ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted and
H. B. 812

122 promulgated pursuant to this chapter. The local issuing authority shall specify on the
123 permit the conditions under which the activity may be undertaken.
124 (b) The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as

126 or her successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment
127 control plan or that the holder or his or her successor in title is in violation of this chapter
128 or any ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation adopted or promulgated pursuant to this
129 chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him or her as to all or
