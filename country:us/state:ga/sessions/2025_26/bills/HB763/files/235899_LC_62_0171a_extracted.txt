273 amount of any deficit for the cost of the project or projects which, unless otherwise provided
274 in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be
275 deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without
276 preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purposes. If the proceeds of the
277 bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds

300 SECTION 17.
301 Credit not pledged.
302 Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a
303 debt of either the City of Richmond Hill or Bryan County, or any municipality therein, but
304 such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance
305 of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the said city or
306 county, or any municipality therein, to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever
307 therefor or to make any appropriation for such payment, and all such bonds shall contain
308 recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section.
309 SECTION 18.
310 Trust indenture as security.
311 In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust
312 indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust
313 company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such
314 trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the
315 authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus
316 property of the authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the
317 issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting
318 and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper
319 and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in
320 relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance,
321 operation, repair, and insuring of the property, and the custody, safeguarding, and application
322 of all moneys, including the proceeds derived from the sale or lease of property of the
323 authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed
H. B. 763
- 14 -
25 LC 62 0171
324 and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects
325 employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the
326 bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any
327 depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such
328 purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which
329 additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company
330 incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such
331 indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such
332 indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may
333 restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures
334 securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust
335 indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and
336 proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust
337 indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the
338 project affected by such indenture.
339 SECTION 19.
340 To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid.
341 The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the
342 trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer
343 or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such
344 funds to hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such regulations as this
345 Act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide.

346 SECTION 20.
347 Sinking fund.
348 The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects,
349 regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular
350 project for which bonds have been issued and any moneys derived from the sale or lease of
351 any properties, both real and personal, of the authority, unless otherwise pledged and
352 allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and
353 interest on such revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of
354 the bonds or the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever
355 source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all
356 sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust
357 indenture into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to, and charged with,
358 the payment of:
359 (1) The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due;
360 (2) The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due;
361 (3) The necessary charges of a paying agent or agents for paying interest and principal;
362 (4) Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided; and
363 (5) Any other reasonable or necessary costs or expenses relating to such bond issue.
364 The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be
365 provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust
366 indenture, however, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust
367 indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without
368 distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution

273 amount of any deficit for the cost of the project or projects which, unless otherwise provided
274 in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be
275 deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without
276 preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purposes. If the proceeds of the
277 bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds

296 issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective
297 immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution
298 may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority

300 SECTION 17.
301 Credit not pledged.
302 Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a
303 debt of either the City of Richmond Hill or Bryan County, or any municipality therein, but
304 such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance
305 of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the said city or
306 county, or any municipality therein, to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever
307 therefor or to make any appropriation for such payment, and all such bonds shall contain
308 recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section.
309 SECTION 18.
310 Trust indenture as security.
311 In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust
312 indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust
313 company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such
314 trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the
315 authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus
316 property of the authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the
317 issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting
318 and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper
319 and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in
320 relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance,
321 operation, repair, and insuring of the property, and the custody, safeguarding, and application
322 of all moneys, including the proceeds derived from the sale or lease of property of the
323 authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed

324 and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects
325 employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the
326 bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any
327 depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such
328 purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which
329 additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company
330 incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such
331 indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such
332 indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may
333 restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures
334 securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust
335 indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and
336 proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust
337 indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the
338 project affected by such indenture.
339 SECTION 19.
340 To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid.
341 The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the
342 trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer
343 or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such
344 funds to hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such regulations as this
345 Act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide.

347 Sinking fund.
348 The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects,
349 regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular
350 project for which bonds have been issued and any moneys derived from the sale or lease of
351 any properties, both real and personal, of the authority, unless otherwise pledged and
352 allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and
353 interest on such revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of
354 the bonds or the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever
355 source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all
356 sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust
357 indenture into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to, and charged with,
358 the payment of:
359 (1) The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due;
360 (2) The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due;
361 (3) The necessary charges of a paying agent or agents for paying interest and principal;
362 (4) Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided; and
363 (5) Any other reasonable or necessary costs or expenses relating to such bond issue.
364 The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be
365 provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust
366 indenture, however, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust
367 indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without
368 distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution
369 authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking
370 fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so
371 purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued.

377 or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other
378 proceedings protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or
379 granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel
380 performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be
381 performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and
382 collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services

388 provisions of this Act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The
389 issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities, and all other details thereof, the
390 rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be
391 governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable.

396 municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or the
397 United States government or any department or agency of the United States government, if
398 subject to be sued, which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of

402 be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the
403 contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the
404 authority. The bonds when validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and

406 municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of this state or the United
407 States government if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said

420 bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority shall be created which will
421 compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of
422 the holders of such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds hereunder, the provisions hereof
423 shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.
424 SECTION 26.
