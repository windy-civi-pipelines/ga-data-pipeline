37 (B) By showing excusable neglect;
38 (C) By showing that the failure to timely file such motion for new trial or notice of

44 appeal and the judge shall have the discretion to allow an extension of time for filing such
45 motion or notice as set forth in Code Section 5-6-39.

51 decision in Cook v. State, 313 Ga. 471 (2022), and its progeny, shall have the right to move
52 for leave to file an out-of-time motion for new trial or notice of appeal until June 30, 2026,
