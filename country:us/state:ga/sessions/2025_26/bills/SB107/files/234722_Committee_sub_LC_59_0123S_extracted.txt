52 order for foreclosure in the same manner as other liens for the improvement of real
53 property, subject to the limitations set forth in Code Section 44-3-270 and to superior liens
54 or encumbrances, but any such court order for judicial foreclosure shall not affect the rights
55 of holders of superior liens or encumbrances to exercise any rights or powers afforded to
56 them under their security instruments. The notice provided for in this subsection shall
57 specify the amount of the assessments then due and payable together with authorized late
58 charges and the rate of interest accruing thereon. No foreclosure action against a lien
