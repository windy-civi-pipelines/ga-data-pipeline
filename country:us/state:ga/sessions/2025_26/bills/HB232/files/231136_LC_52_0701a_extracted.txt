682 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to

685 Compact, or promulgated Rules.

687 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the performance
688 of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the

694 States.

696 the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member States,
697 and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
698 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
699 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
700 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means
701 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall

704 the Member States' State Licensing Authority.

714 or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
715 Commission and the defaulting State.
716 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S.

719 including reasonable attorney's fees.

731 District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices
732 to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules.
733 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
734 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
H. B. 232

739 Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its

696 the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member States,
697 and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
698 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the

25 LC 52 0701

761 participation in the Compact.
762 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes

785 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact
786 shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws
787 of all Member States.
788 ARTICLE 13- CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
789 A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed
790 so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of the
791 Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation
792 of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission's rulemaking authority solely for
793 those purposes.
794 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence
795 or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
796 the constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of
797 the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
798 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
799 of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
800 agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
801 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this article, the Commission may deny a State's
802 participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Article 11.B,
803 terminate a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it determines that a
804 constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the Compact.
805 Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
806 State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States
807 and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.

813 with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
814 All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Member States are binding
815 in accordance with their terms.'"
