605 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
606 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each Member State,

650 made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
651 recommended by commenters.
652 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the Rule. Except for
653 an emergency as provided in subsection L of this article, the effective date of the Rule

671 any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged
672 only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall
673 be made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period.

689 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
690 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to

692 service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this
693 Compact, or promulgated Rules.
694 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
695 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the performance
696 of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the
697 Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default

702 States.
703 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from
704 the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member States,
705 and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
706 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
707 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
708 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means
709 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall

712 the Member States' State Licensing Authority.

720 of said notice of termination.
721 G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be in default
722 or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
723 Commission and the defaulting State.
724 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S.
725 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has
726 its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
727 including reasonable attorney's fees.
728 I. Dispute Resolution

733 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.

736 provisions of this Compact and the Commission's Rules.
737 2. By majority vote as provided by Commission Rule, the Commission may initiate legal
738 action against a Member State in default in the United States District Court for the
739 District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices
740 to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules.
741 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
742 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
- 29 -

25 LC 55 0611S
743 litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the
744 exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies
745 available under federal or the defaulting Member State's law.
746 3. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Commission in the U.S. District
747 Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
748 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
749 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.
750 In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
751 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.

753 the Commission.

756 enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
757 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall convene and

801 those purposes.
802 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence
803 or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
