House Resolution 946
By: Representatives Buckner of the 137th and Oliver of the 84th
A RESOLUTION
1 Commending the State of Georgia for its economic leadership and recognizing the
2 importance of transparent, informed decision making; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the State of Georgia has been recognized as the No. 1 state in the nation in
4 which to do business for 11 consecutive years, a testament to its strategic use of natural,
5 human, and infrastructure resources; and
6 WHEREAS, Georgia is richly blessed with abundant water resources, the availability and
7 wise use of which are vital to the state's public health, economic well-being, and continued
8 capacity for growth; and
9 WHEREAS, this economic success has been made possible through the informed
10 stewardship of these finite resources by citizens and their representative governments, a
11 balance that must continue to be nurtured to preserve and enhance prosperity for future
12 generations; and
13 WHEREAS, Georgia's continued economic success and future development will require
14 careful planning for increased energy demand, and it is essential that such planning avoid
15 imposing undue burdens on current consumers or compromising existing services; and

16 WHEREAS, for facilities with high resource demands—such as those requiring extensive
17 energy or water use—it is important to consider not only utility infrastructure but also the
18 cumulative impact on surrounding communities, including noise and other environmental
19 factors; and
20 WHEREAS, members of the Georgia General Assembly regularly receive extensive
21 information in the course of their duties, and while the volume can at times exceed what is
22 readily absorbed, these materials form a critical foundation for representing constituent
23 interests, particularly in support of local government decision making; and
24 WHEREAS, legislators are frequently made aware of and are able to solicit additional
25 information on subjects of local interest with more ease than their constituents—an
26 advantage that can be wisely employed to the advantage of those affected interests; and
27 WHEREAS, a recent example of the need for such transparent information-sharing is the
28 growing number of high-tech data centers proposed in diverse locations across the state,
29 many of which require large quantities of water and electricity, placing significant demands
30 on local utilities and public infrastructure; and
31 WHEREAS, ensuring the timely release of accurate, factual information about the projected
32 economic, employment, fiscal, land use, natural resource, and public utility service impacts
33 of such developments is essential to empowering elected officials and the public to make
34 informed decisions during limited and critical windows of opportunity.
35 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
36 the members of this body commend the State of Georgia for its continued nationwide

40 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
41 public and the press.
