25 LC 112 2837
16 WHEREAS, knowing how to properly perform CPR has encouraged more people to act
17 when faced with a cardiac emergency, and to save more lives from cardiac arrest outside of
18 a hospital, we must increase the number of people who respond to cardiac arrest by calling
19 911, delivering high-quality CPR, and using an AED as soon as it is available; and
20 WHEREAS, the American Heart Association has set a goal of doubling survival rates from
21 cardiac arrest by 2030 by empowering bystanders to become lifesavers and ensuring that
22 everyone, everywhere is prepared to become a vital link in the chain of survival and provide
23 CPR in response to a cardiac emergency.
24 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
25 recognize the rise of cardiovascular disease as the world's leading cause of death and
26 disability, support the recognition of February 2025 as American Heart Month, and
27 encourage the citizens of Georgia to join the Nation of Lifesavers™ by learning CPR.
28 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
29 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and the
30 press.
