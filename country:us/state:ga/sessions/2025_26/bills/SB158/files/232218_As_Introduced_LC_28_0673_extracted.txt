311 (1) 'State property' means any building, land, or other real property owned, leased, or
312 occupied by any department, commission, board, bureau, agency, public corporation, or
313 other instrumentality of the state, including, but not limited to, the Georgia Building

315 provided, however, the term 'state property' that such term shall not include any property,
316 real or personal, owned or leased or otherwise under the jurisdiction of the Board of
317 Regents of the University System of Georgia, the Georgia Education Authority
318 (University), or any county or independent school system of this state.
319 (2) 'Vending facility' means vending stands, vending machines, snack bars, cart service,
320 shelters, counters, and such other appropriate facilities and equipment as may be

S. B. 158
- 13 -
25 LC 28 0673
323 licensed by the agency, as prescribed by rules and regulations adopted by the
324 Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled Persons and the agency, respectively.
325 49-9-41.
326 To effectuate the purposes of this article, it is declared to be public policy of the state that
327 on any state property where the Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled Persons or
328 the board determines it to be feasible to establish a vending facility to be operated by a
329 licensed operator as provided in this article and where the agency or department or
330 custodian of such property determines that such facility can be established without undue
331 inconvenience to the operation being carried on in such state building or property, the
332 preference accorded in this article shall require that such vending facility site not be
333 deemed available for letting to competitive bidders for revenue-producing purposes unless
334 the Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled Persons or the board declines to establish
335 on such site a vending facility for blind persons or other persons with disabilities. The
336 income to the agency or department or custodian controlling the space for such facility sites
337 shall generally not be expected to exceed reimbursement for the cost of providing such
338 facility site space and the services connected therewith; but in any case where such income
339 exceeds those purposes, it shall be paid into the state treasury, subject to certification and
340 audit.
341 49-9-42.
342 For the purpose of providing blind persons or other persons with disabilities with
343 remunerative employment, enlarging their economic opportunities, and stimulating them
344 to greater effort in striving to make themselves self-supporting, such blind persons who are
345 licensed by the Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled Persons pursuant to Code
346 Section 30-11-8 or other persons with disabilities who are licensed by the Georgia
347 Vocational Rehabilitation Agency agency pursuant to Code Section 49-9-5 shall be
348 authorized to operate vending facilities on any state property where such vending facilities
S. B. 158
- 14 -
25 LC 28 0673
349 may be properly and satisfactorily operated by blind persons or other persons with
350 disabilities. In authorizing the operation of vending facilities on state property, preference
351 shall be given, so far as feasible, to blind persons licensed by the Commission for Blind
352 and Visually Disabled Persons or other persons with disabilities licensed by the Georgia
353 Vocational Rehabilitation Agency agency as provided in this article; and the head of each
354 department or agency in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of state
355 property shall, after consultation with the Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled
356 Persons and the board and with the approval of the Governor, prescribe regulations
357 designed to assure such preference (including assignment of vending machine income to
358 achieve and protect such preference) for such licensed blind persons or other persons with
359 disabilities without unduly inconveniencing such departments and agencies or adversely
360 affecting the interests of the state."
361 SECTION 8.
362 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.

311 (1) 'State property' means any building, land, or other real property owned, leased, or
312 occupied by any department, commission, board, bureau, agency, public corporation, or
313 other instrumentality of the state, including, but not limited to, the Georgia Building

315 provided, however, the term 'state property' that such term shall not include any property,
316 real or personal, owned or leased or otherwise under the jurisdiction of the Board of
317 Regents of the University System of Georgia, the Georgia Education Authority
318 (University), or any county or independent school system of this state.
319 (2) 'Vending facility' means vending stands, vending machines, snack bars, cart service,
320 shelters, counters, and such other appropriate facilities and equipment as may be

322 Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled Persons or other persons with disabilities
S. B. 158

25 LC 28 0673
323 licensed by the agency, as prescribed by rules and regulations adopted by the
324 Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled Persons and the agency, respectively.
325 49-9-41.
326 To effectuate the purposes of this article, it is declared to be public policy of the state that
327 on any state property where the Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled Persons or
328 the board determines it to be feasible to establish a vending facility to be operated by a
329 licensed operator as provided in this article and where the agency or department or
330 custodian of such property determines that such facility can be established without undue
331 inconvenience to the operation being carried on in such state building or property, the
332 preference accorded in this article shall require that such vending facility site not be
333 deemed available for letting to competitive bidders for revenue-producing purposes unless
334 the Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled Persons or the board declines to establish
335 on such site a vending facility for blind persons or other persons with disabilities. The
336 income to the agency or department or custodian controlling the space for such facility sites
337 shall generally not be expected to exceed reimbursement for the cost of providing such
338 facility site space and the services connected therewith; but in any case where such income
339 exceeds those purposes, it shall be paid into the state treasury, subject to certification and
340 audit.
341 49-9-42.
342 For the purpose of providing blind persons or other persons with disabilities with
343 remunerative employment, enlarging their economic opportunities, and stimulating them
344 to greater effort in striving to make themselves self-supporting, such blind persons who are
345 licensed by the Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled Persons pursuant to Code
346 Section 30-11-8 or other persons with disabilities who are licensed by the Georgia
347 Vocational Rehabilitation Agency agency pursuant to Code Section 49-9-5 shall be
348 authorized to operate vending facilities on any state property where such vending facilities
S. B. 158
- 14 -

25 LC 28 0673
349 may be properly and satisfactorily operated by blind persons or other persons with
350 disabilities. In authorizing the operation of vending facilities on state property, preference
351 shall be given, so far as feasible, to blind persons licensed by the Commission for Blind
352 and Visually Disabled Persons or other persons with disabilities licensed by the Georgia
353 Vocational Rehabilitation Agency agency as provided in this article; and the head of each
354 department or agency in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of state
355 property shall, after consultation with the Commission for Blind and Visually Disabled
356 Persons and the board and with the approval of the Governor, prescribe regulations
357 designed to assure such preference (including assignment of vending machine income to
358 achieve and protect such preference) for such licensed blind persons or other persons with
359 disabilities without unduly inconveniencing such departments and agencies or adversely
360 affecting the interests of the state."
361 SECTION 8.
362 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
