58 such person qualifies, swear or affirm before the officer before whom such person has
59 qualified to seek the office of sheriff that he or she meets all of the qualifications required

179 delivered to the head of the employing agency, the affected peace officer, and the

301 convincing evidence. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed so as to
302 affect or limit rights or remedies provided by federal law.
303 (5)(4) Before taking final action on an application for employment based, in whole or in

305 employer, a law enforcement agency shall inform the applicant, candidate, or peace

317 require any person to provide self-incriminating information or otherwise to compel any
318 person to act in violation of his or her right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the
319 United States Constitution and Article I, Section I, Paragraph XVI of the Georgia
320 Constitution. It shall not be a violation of this Code section subsection for a person to fail
321 to provide requested information based on a claim that such information is
322 self-incriminating provided that notice of such claim is served in lieu of the requested
323 information. An action against such person to require disclosure on the grounds that the
324 claim of self-incrimination is not substantiated may be brought in the superior court of
325 the county of such party's residence or where such information is located.
326 (c) A law enforcement agency that receives notice from a prosecuting attorney that the
327 name of an affected peace officer has been placed on a Giglio list shall forward a copy of
328 such notice to the council within 30 days of receipt for review pursuant to Code

23 SECTION 1.

25 Section 15-16-1, relating to qualification requirements for sheriff and exemptions, by
26 revising subparagraph (J) of paragraph (1) and paragraph (2) of subsection (c) and by

31 Standards and Training Council and files with the officer before whom such person
32 qualifies a form signed by the executive director of the Georgia Peace Officer Standards
33 and Training Council, or his or her designee, that attests and certifies such; provided,
34 however, that any person who is not a certified peace officer at the time of qualifying
35 as a candidate for the office of sheriff but is a first responder, as such term is defined
36 in Code Section 45-25-2, is a retired or honorably discharged member of the United

39 to seek the office of sheriff that he or she is capable of and will complete the
40 requirements for certification within six months after taking office. Any person such
41 first responder, retired or honorably discharged member of the United States armed
42 forces, or former or current local, state, or federal law enforcement officer who is not

49 complete the basic training course and certification requirements due to illness, injury,
50 military service, or other reasons deemed sufficient by such council. The Georgia

52 space is available for newly elected sheriffs who are not certified or registered peace
53 officers to attend the course as soon as possible after such persons take office. Such
54 council shall notify the appropriate judge of the probate court whenever a newly elected
55 sheriff who is not certified fails to become certified as a peace officer pursuant to the
56 requirements of this subparagraph.
57 (2) Each person offering his or her candidacy for the office of sheriff shall at the time
58 such person qualifies, swear or affirm before the officer before whom such person has
59 qualified to seek the office of sheriff that he or she meets all of the qualifications required
60 by this subsection, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (J) of paragraph (1) of
61 this subsection, and at the time such person qualifies, that he or she has complied or will
62 comply with the requirements of subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of this subsection no
63 later than the close of business on the third business day following the close of such
64 qualification period, and that, if applicable, he or she will comply with the requirements
65 of subparagraph (J) of paragraph (1) of this subsection within six months of taking office.
66 Any person who knowingly provides false information in executing the affidavit required

69 document in violation of Code Section 16-10-20."

179 delivered to the head of the employing agency, the affected peace officer, and the
180 prosecuting attorney who placed the affected peace officer on a Giglio list. No peace

216 procedure, hearings, and review, by revising subsection (a) as follows:

258 The provisions of this paragraph establish only the minimum requirements of academy
259 entrance examinations for peace officer candidates in this state; each law enforcement
260 unit agency is encouraged to provide such additional requirements and any
261 preemployment examination as it deems necessary and appropriate. Any person with a

264 the requirements of this paragraph.
265 (b) Any person authorized to attend the basic training course prior to employment as a

277 term shall not include information prohibited from disclosure by federal law or any
278 document not in the possession of the employer at the time a request for such information

25 HB 288/AP

281 continuing the certification of a peace officer, an employer shall disclose employment

286 such employer from any and all liability for disclosing complete and accurate information
287 to the law enforcement agency.
288 (3)(2) An employer may charge a reasonable fee to cover actual costs incurred in

292 to prepare or create any document not already in the employer's possession at the time a
293 request for employment related information is received. Any employment related
294 information provided pursuant to this subsection that is not subject to public disclosure

296 from public disclosure as a record of the requesting law enforcement agency.
297 (4)(3) No employer or law enforcement agency shall be subject to any civil liability for

300 such cause of action, malice or bad faith shall only be demonstrated by clear and
301 convincing evidence. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed so as to
302 affect or limit rights or remedies provided by federal law.
303 (5)(4) Before taking final action on an application for employment based, in whole or in
304 part, on any unfavorable employment related information received from a previous
305 employer, a law enforcement agency shall inform the applicant, candidate, or peace

308 the applicant's, candidate's, or peace officer's request, the law enforcement agency shall
309 allow him or her to inspect the employment related information and to submit a written
310 response to such information. The request for inspection shall be made within five
311 business days from the date that the applicant, candidate, or peace officer is notified of
312 the law enforcement agency's receipt of such employment related information. The
313 inspection shall occur not later than ten business days after said notification. Any
314 response to the employment related information shall be made by the applicant,
315 candidate, or peace officer not later than three business days after his or her inspection.
316 (6)(5) Nothing contained in this Code section subsection shall be construed so as to
317 require any person to provide self-incriminating information or otherwise to compel any
318 person to act in violation of his or her right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the
319 United States Constitution and Article I, Section I, Paragraph XVI of the Georgia
320 Constitution. It shall not be a violation of this Code section subsection for a person to fail
321 to provide requested information based on a claim that such information is
322 self-incriminating provided that notice of such claim is served in lieu of the requested
323 information. An action against such person to require disclosure on the grounds that the
324 claim of self-incrimination is not substantiated may be brought in the superior court of
325 the county of such party's residence or where such information is located.
326 (c) A law enforcement agency that receives notice from a prosecuting attorney that the
327 name of an affected peace officer has been placed on a Giglio list shall forward a copy of
328 such notice to the council within 30 days of receipt for review pursuant to Code
329 Section 35-8-7.1."
