- 9 -
25 LC 39 4532
222 shall be administered prior to entrance to the basic course provided for in Code Sections

228 examination as it deems necessary and appropriate. Any person with a degree from a

242 is received.
243 (b)(1)(2) Where an investigation is conducted for the purpose of hiring, certifying, or
244 continuing the certification of a peace officer, an employer shall disclose employment
245 related information to the investigating law enforcement agency upon receiving a written
246 request from such agency. Disclosure shall only be required under this subsection if the
247 law enforcement agency's request is accompanied by a copy of a signed, notarized
H. B. 288
- 10 -
25 LC 39 4532
248 statement from the applicant, candidate, or peace officer releasing and holding harmless
249 such employer from any and all liability for disclosing complete and accurate information

251 (3)(2) An employer may charge a reasonable fee to cover actual costs incurred in
252 copying and furnishing documents pursuant to this subsection to a requesting law
253 enforcement agency, including retrieving and redacting costs, provided such amount shall
254 not exceed $25.00 or 25¢ per page, whichever is greater. No employer shall be required
255 to prepare or create any document not already in the employer's possession at the time a
256 request for employment related information is received. Any employment related

260 (4)(3) No employer or law enforcement agency shall be subject to any civil liability for
261 any cause of action by virtue of disclosing complete and accurate information to a law
262 enforcement agency in good faith and without malice pursuant to this subsection. In any
263 such cause of action, malice or bad faith shall only be demonstrated by clear and
264 convincing evidence. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed so as to
265 affect or limit rights or remedies provided by federal law.
266 (5)(4) Before taking final action on an application for employment based, in whole or in
267 part, on any unfavorable employment related information received from a previous
268 employer, a law enforcement agency shall inform the applicant, candidate, or peace
269 officer that it has received such employment related information and that the applicant,
270 candidate, or peace officer may inspect and respond in writing to such information. Upon
271 the applicant's, candidate's, or peace officer's request, the law enforcement agency shall
272 allow him or her to inspect the employment related information and to submit a written
273 response to such information. The request for inspection shall be made within five
274 business days from the date that the applicant, candidate, or peace officer is notified of
H. B. 288
- 11 -
25 LC 39 4532
275 the law enforcement agency's receipt of such employment related information. The
276 inspection shall occur not later than ten business days after said notification. Any
277 response to the employment related information shall be made by the applicant,
278 candidate, or peace officer not later than three business days after his or her inspection.
279 (6)(5) Nothing contained in this Code section subsection shall be construed so as to
280 require any person to provide self-incriminating information or otherwise to compel any
281 person to act in violation of his or her right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the
282 United States Constitution and Article I, Section I, Paragraph XVI of the Georgia
283 Constitution. It shall not be a violation of this Code section subsection for a person to fail
284 to provide requested information based on a claim that such information is
285 self-incriminating provided that notice of such claim is served in lieu of the requested
286 information. An action against such person to require disclosure on the grounds that the
287 claim of self-incrimination is not substantiated may be brought in the superior court of
288 the county of such party's residence or where such information is located.
289 (c) A law enforcement agency that receives an impairment letter shall forward a copy of
290 such letter to the council within 30 days of receipt for review pursuant to Code Section
291 35-8-7.1. No employer or law enforcement agency shall discharge, suspend, demote, or
292 take any other adverse employment action against a peace officer based solely upon the
293 receipt of an impairment letter; provided, however, that such prohibition shall not apply to
294 an impairment letter which has been reviewed and substantiated by the council."
295 SECTION 11.
296 Part 1 of Article 4 of Chapter 12 of Title 15 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated,
297 relating to general provisions relative to grand juries, is amended by replacing "Article 1 of

- 9 -

25 LC 39 4532
222 shall be administered prior to entrance to the basic course provided for in Code Sections
223 35-8-9 and 35-8-11. The council may change or modify such examination and shall
224 establish the criteria for determining satisfactory performance on such examination. The
225 provisions of this paragraph establish only the minimum requirements of academy
226 entrance examinations for peace officer candidates in this state; each law enforcement
227 unit is encouraged to provide such additional requirements and any preemployment
228 examination as it deems necessary and appropriate. Any person with a degree from a

238 officer's performance or behavior while employed by such prior employer, including
239 performance evaluations, records of disciplinary actions, and eligibility for rehire. Such
240 term shall not include information prohibited from disclosure by federal law or any
241 document not in the possession of the employer at the time a request for such information
242 is received.
243 (b)(1)(2) Where an investigation is conducted for the purpose of hiring, certifying, or
244 continuing the certification of a peace officer, an employer shall disclose employment
245 related information to the investigating law enforcement agency upon receiving a written
246 request from such agency. Disclosure shall only be required under this subsection if the
247 law enforcement agency's request is accompanied by a copy of a signed, notarized
H. B. 288
- 10 -

25 LC 39 4532
248 statement from the applicant, candidate, or peace officer releasing and holding harmless
249 such employer from any and all liability for disclosing complete and accurate information
250 to the law enforcement agency.
251 (3)(2) An employer may charge a reasonable fee to cover actual costs incurred in
252 copying and furnishing documents pursuant to this subsection to a requesting law
253 enforcement agency, including retrieving and redacting costs, provided such amount shall
254 not exceed $25.00 or 25¢ per page, whichever is greater. No employer shall be required
255 to prepare or create any document not already in the employer's possession at the time a
256 request for employment related information is received. Any employment related
257 information provided pursuant to this subsection that is not subject to public disclosure
258 while in the possession of a prior employer shall continue to be privileged and protected
259 from public disclosure as a record of the requesting law enforcement agency.
260 (4)(3) No employer or law enforcement agency shall be subject to any civil liability for
261 any cause of action by virtue of disclosing complete and accurate information to a law
262 enforcement agency in good faith and without malice pursuant to this subsection. In any
263 such cause of action, malice or bad faith shall only be demonstrated by clear and
264 convincing evidence. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed so as to
265 affect or limit rights or remedies provided by federal law.
266 (5)(4) Before taking final action on an application for employment based, in whole or in
267 part, on any unfavorable employment related information received from a previous
268 employer, a law enforcement agency shall inform the applicant, candidate, or peace
269 officer that it has received such employment related information and that the applicant,
270 candidate, or peace officer may inspect and respond in writing to such information. Upon
271 the applicant's, candidate's, or peace officer's request, the law enforcement agency shall
272 allow him or her to inspect the employment related information and to submit a written
273 response to such information. The request for inspection shall be made within five
274 business days from the date that the applicant, candidate, or peace officer is notified of
H. B. 288
- 11 -

25 LC 39 4532
275 the law enforcement agency's receipt of such employment related information. The
276 inspection shall occur not later than ten business days after said notification. Any
277 response to the employment related information shall be made by the applicant,
278 candidate, or peace officer not later than three business days after his or her inspection.
279 (6)(5) Nothing contained in this Code section subsection shall be construed so as to
280 require any person to provide self-incriminating information or otherwise to compel any
281 person to act in violation of his or her right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the
282 United States Constitution and Article I, Section I, Paragraph XVI of the Georgia
283 Constitution. It shall not be a violation of this Code section subsection for a person to fail
284 to provide requested information based on a claim that such information is
285 self-incriminating provided that notice of such claim is served in lieu of the requested
286 information. An action against such person to require disclosure on the grounds that the
287 claim of self-incrimination is not substantiated may be brought in the superior court of
288 the county of such party's residence or where such information is located.
289 (c) A law enforcement agency that receives an impairment letter shall forward a copy of
290 such letter to the council within 30 days of receipt for review pursuant to Code Section
291 35-8-7.1. No employer or law enforcement agency shall discharge, suspend, demote, or
292 take any other adverse employment action against a peace officer based solely upon the
293 receipt of an impairment letter; provided, however, that such prohibition shall not apply to
294 an impairment letter which has been reviewed and substantiated by the council."
295 SECTION 11.
296 Part 1 of Article 4 of Chapter 12 of Title 15 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated,
297 relating to general provisions relative to grand juries, is amended by replacing "Article 1 of
