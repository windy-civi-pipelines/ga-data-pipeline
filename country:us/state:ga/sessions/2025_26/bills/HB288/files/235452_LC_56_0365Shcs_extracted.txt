246 employer, a law enforcement agency shall inform the applicant, candidate, or peace
247 officer that it has received such employment related information and that the applicant,

284 suspend, discharge, impose discipline, or take adverse employment action upon an affected
285 peace officer solely based upon the placement of such peace officer's name on a Giglio list.
286 (c) A law enforcement agency that employs an affected peace officer shall be authorized
287 to demote, suspend, discharge, impose discipline, or take adverse employment action upon
288 an affected peace officer when:
289 (1) An internal investigation establishes, based upon a preponderance of the evidence,
290 that a factual basis exists for the reason provided by the prosecuting attorney for
291 placement of the affected peace officer on a Giglio list; or
292 (2) The council has imposed discipline upon the affected peace officer for the conduct
293 identified by the prosecuting attorney which was the basis for placement of such officer

246 employer, a law enforcement agency shall inform the applicant, candidate, or peace
247 officer that it has received such employment related information and that the applicant,

286 (c) A law enforcement agency that employs an affected peace officer shall be authorized
287 to demote, suspend, discharge, impose discipline, or take adverse employment action upon
288 an affected peace officer when:
