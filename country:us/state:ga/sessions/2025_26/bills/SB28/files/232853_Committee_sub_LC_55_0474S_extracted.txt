95 in Code Section 50-13-4, relating to procedural requirements for adoption, amendment, or
96 repeal of rules, emergency rules, limitation on action to contest rule, and legislative override,
97 by revising subsections (a), (b), (e), and (f) as follows:
98 "(a) Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule, other than interpretive rules
99 or general statements of policy, the agency shall consider the economic impact of the
100 proposed rule and shall:
101 (1) Give at least 30 days' notice of its intended action. The notice shall include an exact
102 copy of the proposed rule and a synopsis of the proposed rule. The synopsis shall be
103 distributed with and in the same manner as the proposed rule. The synopsis shall contain
104 a statement of the purpose and the main features of the proposed rule, and, in the case of
105 a proposed amendatory rule, the synopsis also shall indicate the differences between the
106 existing rule and the proposed rule. The notice shall also include the exact date on which
107 the agency shall consider the adoption of the proposed rule and shall include the time and
108 place in order that interested persons may present their views thereon. The notice shall
109 also contain a citation of the authority pursuant to which the rule is proposed for adoption
110 and, if the proposal is an amendment or repeal of an existing rule, the existing rule shall
111 be clearly identified. For any proposed rule for which the agency reasonably anticipates
- 5 -
25 LC 55 0474S
112 that $1 million or more in cumulative implementation and compliance costs are
113 reasonably expected to be incurred by or passed along to individuals, businesses, and
114 units of local government as the result of the proposed rule over the initial five-year
115 period following the effective date of such proposed rule, the agency shall prepare and
116 there shall be included with the notice an economic analysis of the impact of the proposed
117 rule. If the agency determines that such cumulative implementation and compliance costs
118 of a proposed rule will be less than $1 million over the initial five-year period following
119 the effective date of such proposed rule, the agency shall prepare and there shall be
120 included with the notice a statement explaining the agency's rationale in making such
121 determination. An economic impact analysis required to be prepared by an agency and
122 included in the notice of a proposed rule under this paragraph shall include the following:
123 (A) An estimate, and identification when possible, of the number of individuals,
124 businesses, and units of local government subject to the proposed rule;
125 (B) The projected reporting, record keeping, and other administrative costs and time
126 required for compliance with the proposed rule, including the types of professional
127 skills necessary for preparation of any documentation, records, or reports required by
128 the proposed rule;
129 (C) A statement of the probable effect of the rule on impacted individuals, businesses,
130 and units of local government;
131 (D) Whether the proposed rule is mandated by federal law as a requirement for
132 participating in or implementing a federally subsidized or assisted program and whether
133 the proposed rule exceeds the requirements of such applicable federal law;
134 (E) A comparison of the anticipated costs and benefits of the proposed rule;
135 (F) A description of the efforts taken by the agency to minimize the cost and impact
136 of the proposed rule on individuals, businesses, and units of local government in this
137 state; and
- 6 -
25 LC 55 0474S
138 (G) Such other provisions or information the agency deems reasonably necessary for
139 the General Assembly and the public to assess the economic impact of the proposed
140 rule.
141 The notice shall be mailed to all persons who have requested in writing that they be
142 placed upon a mailing list which shall be maintained by the agency for advance notice
143 of its rule-making proceedings and who have tendered the actual cost of such mailing as
144 from time to time estimated by the agency and to the Office of Planning and Budget or
145 other designee of the Governor;
146 (2) Afford to all interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or
147 arguments, orally or in writing. In the case of substantive rules, opportunity for oral
148 hearing must be granted if requested by 25 persons who will be directly affected by the
149 proposed rule, by a governmental subdivision, or by an association having not less
150 than 25 members. The agency shall consider fully all written and oral submissions
151 respecting the proposed rule. Upon adoption of a rule, the agency, if requested to do so
152 by an interested person either prior to adoption or within 30 days thereafter, shall issue
153 a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against its adoption and incorporate
154 therein its reason for overruling the consideration urged against its adoption;
155 (3) In the formulation and adoption of any rule which will have an economic impact on
156 businesses in the state, reduce the economic impact of the rule on small businesses which
157 are independently owned and operated, are not dominant in their field, and
158 employ 100 300 employees or less fewer by implementing one or more of the following
159 actions when it is legal and feasible in meeting the stated objectives of the statutes which
160 are the basis of the proposed rule:
161 (A) Establish differing reduced compliance or reporting requirements or and differing
162 timetables for small businesses;
163 (B) Clarify, consolidate, or simplify the compliance and reporting requirements under
164 the rule for small businesses;
- 7 -
25 LC 55 0474S
165 (C) Establish performance rather than design standards for small businesses; or
166 (D) Exempt small businesses from any or all requirements of the rules;
167 (4) In the formulation and adoption of any rule which places administrative burdens on
168 charitable organizations in this state, including, but not limited to, any rule that would
169 require any new or expanded filing or reporting requirements or that would limit the
170 ability of charitable organizations to solicit or collect funds, the agency or official shall:
171 (A) Absent the showing of a compelling state interest, not impose any annual filing or
172 reporting requirements on an organization regulated or specifically exempted from
173 regulation under Chapter 17 of Title 43, the 'Georgia Charitable Solicitations Act of
174 1988,' that are more burdensome than the requirements authorized by applicable law,
175 and any such filing or reporting requirements shall be narrowly tailored to achieve such
176 compelling state interest. The requirements of this subparagraph shall not apply to the
177 state's direct spending programs; and
178 (B) Email the notice provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection to each
179 chairperson of any standing committee in each house as shown on the General
180 Assembly's public website.
181 For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'charitable organization' means a nonprofit
182 charitable organization which is exempt from taxation under the provisions of
183 Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code; and
184 (5) In the formulation and adoption of any rule, an agency shall choose an alternative
185 that does not impose excessive regulatory costs on any regulated person or entity which
186 costs could be reduced by a less expensive alternative that fully accomplishes the stated
187 objectives of the statutes which are the basis of the proposed rule.
188 (b) If any agency finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare,
189 including, but not limited to, summary processes such as quarantines, contrabands,
190 seizures, and the like authorized by law without notice, requires adoption of a rule,
191 including a rule that would require an economic impact analysis if adopted pursuant to
- 8 -
25 LC 55 0474S
192 subsection (a) of this Code section, upon fewer than 30 days' notice and states in writing
193 its reasons for that finding, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon any
194 abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable to adopt an emergency rule. Any
195 such rule adopted relative to a public health emergency shall be submitted as promptly as
196 reasonably practicable to the House of Representatives and Senate Committees on
197 Judiciary, provided that any such rule adopted relative to a state of emergency by the State
198 Election Board shall be submitted as soon as practicable but not later than 20 days prior to
199 the rule taking effect. Any emergency rule adopted by the State Election Board pursuant
200 to the provisions of this subsection may be suspended upon the majority vote of the House
201 of Representatives or Senate Committees on Judiciary within ten days of the receipt of such
202 rule by the committees. The rule may be effective for a period of not longer than 120 days
203 but adoption of an emergency rule pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall not
204 preclude the adoption of an identical rule under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of
205 this Code section is not precluded; provided, however, that such a rule adopted pursuant
206 to discharge of responsibility under an executive order declaring a state of emergency or
207 disaster exists as a result of a public health emergency, as defined in Code Section 38-3-3,
208 shall be effective for the duration of the emergency or disaster and for a period of not more
209 than 120 days thereafter."
210 "(e)(1) The agency shall transmit the notice provided for in paragraph (1) of
211 subsection (a) of this Code section to the legislative counsel. The notice shall be
212 transmitted at least 30 days prior to the date of the agency's intended action.
213 (2) Within three days after receipt of the notice, if possible, the legislative counsel shall
214 furnish the presiding officers of each house with a copy of the notice, and, except for
215 notices concerning a proposed rule for which an economic impact analysis is required
216 pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section, the presiding officers
217 shall assign the notice to the chairperson of the appropriate standing committee in each
218 house for review and any member thereof who makes a standing written request. In the
- 9 -
25 LC 55 0474S
219 event a presiding officer is unavailable for the purpose of making the assignment within
220 the time limitations, the legislative counsel shall assign the notice to the chairperson of
221 the appropriate standing committee. The legislative counsel shall also transmit within the
222 time limitations provided in this subsection a notice of the assignment to the chairperson
223 of the appropriate standing committee. Each standing committee of the Senate and the
224 House of Representatives is granted all the rights provided for interested persons and
225 governmental subdivisions in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section.
226 (3) For any proposed rule that is adopted by an agency for which an economic impact
227 analysis is required pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section, it
228 shall be the duty of the agency to notify the presiding officers of the Senate and the
229 House of Representatives and the legislative counsel of such adoption within ten days
230 after the adoption of the rule. Such rule may then be considered by the General
231 Assembly as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (f) of this Code section.
232 (f)(1) In the event a standing committee to which a notice is assigned as provided in
233 subsection (e) of this Code section files an objection objects to a proposed rule prior to
234 its adoption and the agency adopts the proposed rule over the objection, the rule may be
235 considered by the branch house of the General Assembly whose committee objected to
236 its adoption by the introduction of a resolution for the purpose of overriding the rule at
237 any time within the first 30 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly. It
238 shall be the duty of any agency which adopts a proposed rule over such objection so to
239 notify the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the
240 chairpersons of the Senate and House committees to which the rule was referred, and the
241 legislative counsel within ten days after the adoption of the rule. In the event the
242 resolution is adopted by such branch house of the General Assembly, it shall be
243 immediately transmitted to the other branch house of the General Assembly. It shall be
244 the duty of the presiding officer of the other branch house of the General Assembly to
245 have such branch house, within five days after the receipt of the resolution, to consider
- 10 -
25 LC 55 0474S
246 the resolution for the purpose of overriding the rule. In the event the resolution is
247 adopted by two-thirds of the votes of each branch house of the General Assembly, the
248 rule shall be void on the day after the adoption of the resolution by the second branch
249 house of the General Assembly. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than
250 two-thirds of the votes of either branch house, the resolution shall be submitted to the
251 Governor for his or her approval or veto. In the event of his or her the Governor's veto,
252 or if no resolution is introduced for the purpose of overriding the rule, or if the resolution
253 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each house of the General
254 Assembly, the rule shall remain in effect adopted and shall become or remain effective

256 approval the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall be void on the day after
257 the date of his or her approval.
258 (2) In the event each standing committee to which a notice is assigned as provided in
259 subsection (e) of this Code section files an objection objects to a proposed rule prior to
260 its adoption by a two-thirds' vote of the members of the committee who were voting
261 members on the tenth day of the current session, after having given public notice of the
262 time, place, and purpose of such vote at least 48 hours in advance, as well as the
263 opportunity for members of the public, including the promulgating agency, to have a
264 reasonable time to comment on the proposed committee action at the hearing, the
265 effectiveness of such rule shall be stayed until the next legislative session at which time
266 the rule may be considered by the General Assembly by the introduction of a resolution
267 in either branch of the General Assembly for the purpose of overriding the rule at any
268 time within the first 30 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly not be
269 adopted by the promulgating agency and shall instead be deemed withdrawn by the
270 promulgating agency unless such agency, within the first 15 days of the next regular
271 session of the General Assembly, transmits written notification to the chairpersons of the
272 objecting committees that such agency does not intend to withdraw such rule but instead
- 11 -
25 LC 55 0474S
273 intends to adopt such rule following adjournment sine die of that regular session. Such
274 notification shall include a detailed statement setting forth the basis for and necessity of
275 the proposed rule, an explanation of how the adoption of the proposed rule is within the
276 authority of the promulgating agency, any alternatives to the proposed rule considered
277 by the promulgating agency, and the potential costs or adverse effects of the proposed
278 rule, as well as the identification of those likely to bear such costs or adverse effects. A
279 resolution objecting to the intended adoption of the proposed rule may be introduced in
280 either house of the General Assembly after the fifteenth day but before the thirtieth day
281 of the regular session in which the notice of intent not to withdraw the proposed rule was
282 given by the promulgating agency in accordance with this paragraph. In the event the
283 resolution is adopted by the branch house of the General Assembly in which it was
284 introduced, it shall be immediately transmitted to the other branch house of the General
285 Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding officer of the other branch house of the
286 General Assembly to have such branch house, within five days after the receipt of the
287 resolution, to consider the resolution for the purpose of overriding objecting to the
288 intended adoption of the proposed rule. In the event the resolution is adopted by
289 two-thirds of the votes of each branch house of the General Assembly, the proposed rule
290 shall be void on the day after the adoption of the resolution by the second branch of the
291 General Assembly shall be disapproved and shall not be adopted by the promulgating
292 agency. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than two-thirds of the votes of either
293 branch house, the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her approval
294 or veto. In the event of his or her the Governor's veto, the rule shall remain in effect or
295 if no resolution is introduced objecting to the proposed rule, or if the resolution
296 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each house of the General
297 Assembly, the proposed rule shall automatically become adopted the day following
298 adjournment sine die of that regular session and shall become effective in accordance
299 with the provisions of Code Section 50-13-6. In the event of his or her the Governor's
- 12 -
25 LC 55 0474S
300 approval of the resolution, the proposed rule shall be void on the day after the date of his
301 or her approval disapproved and shall not be adopted by the promulgating agency. If
302 after the thirtieth legislative day of the legislative session of which the challenged rule
303 was to be considered the General Assembly has not considered an override of the
304 challenged rule pursuant to this subsection, the rule shall then immediately take effect.
305 (3) Any proposed rule for which an economic impact analysis is required pursuant to
306 paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section that is adopted by an agency may be
307 considered by either house of the General Assembly by the introduction of a resolution
308 for the purpose of ratifying the rule at any time within the first 30 days of the next regular
309 session of the General Assembly. In the event the resolution is adopted by a house of the
310 General Assembly, it shall be immediately transmitted to the other house of the General
311 Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding officer of the other house of the General
312 Assembly to have such house, within five days after the receipt of the resolution, to
313 consider the resolution for the purpose of ratifying the rule. In the event the resolution
314 is adopted by two-thirds of the votes of each house of the General Assembly, the rule
315 shall remain adopted and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of
316 Code Section 50-13-6. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than two-thirds of the
317 votes of either house, the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her
318 approval or veto. In the event of the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall
319 remain adopted and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of Code
320 Section 50-13-6. In the event of the Governor's veto, or if no resolution is introduced for
321 the purpose of ratifying the rule, or if the resolution introduced is not approved by at least
322 a majority of the vote of each house of the General Assembly, the rule shall be void and
323 shall not take effect."

364 become effective immediately upon adoption or within a period of less than 20 days. The
365 emergency rule, with a copy of the finding as required by subsection (b) of Code
366 Section 50-13-4, shall be filed with the office of the Secretary of State within four
367 working days after its adoption.
368 (d) The Secretary of State shall prescribe rules governing the manner and form in which

371 SECTION 2-4.
372 Said title is further amended by adding new Code sections to read as follows:
373 "50-13-24.
374 (a) Not later than July 1, 2027, the Office of Planning and Budget or other designee of the
375 Governor shall establish and publish a schedule for the review of the rules of all agencies,
376 subject to the provisions of this chapter, on a four-year cycle, with the first of such reviews
- 15 -
25 LC 55 0474S
377 occurring in the 2028 calendar year. In establishing such schedule, the Office of Planning
378 and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall take into consideration the volume of
379 rules that will be subject to review in any given year and the ability of the public to provide
380 meaningful input into such reviews. An agency that has been through a review under this
381 Code section previously and, in the intervening years since such last review, has decreased
382 the number of its rules by 10 percent or more shall be exempt from review under this Code
383 section during that cycle.
384 (b) The Office of Planning and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall notify in
385 December of the immediately preceding year each agency whose rules are subject to
386 review in a given calendar year of the upcoming review period. All rules of an agency that
387 are scheduled for review under this Code section shall stand automatically repealed on
388 December 31 of the review year unless the rules are continued or repromulgated pursuant
389 to this Code section.
390 (c) In the year of review, each agency shall undertake an analysis of each of its rules and
391 shall create a written report of the results of such analysis. Such analysis shall consider:
392 (1) Whether the benefits sought to be achieved by the rule are being realized and are in
393 compliance with current law;
394 (2) Whether such benefits justify the costs of implementing and complying with the
395 provisions of the rule; and
396 (3) Whether there are less restrictive and less costly alternatives to accomplish the
397 desired benefits or results.
398 The Office of Planning and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall develop and
399 provide to each agency a standardized process and forms for such analysis and shall make
400 such process and forms available on the Office of Planning and Budget's public website not
401 later than October 1, 2027. Such analysis shall be completed not later than September 1
402 of the year of review. Such analysis shall be published on the agency's public website upon
- 16 -
25 LC 55 0474S
403 its completion and shall be submitted to the Office of Planning and Budget or other
404 designee of the Governor for review.
405 (d) As a part of the rules analysis process, each agency shall solicit public input on the
406 impact, cost, and effectiveness of its rules. The public shall be notified of the opportunity
407 to provide such input in a manner designed to obtain the widest possible public notification
408 of interested parties, as well as by mailing such notice to all persons who have requested
409 in writing that they be placed upon the mailing list maintained by the agency for advance
410 notice of its rule-making proceedings. The notice shall include a date by which public
411 input shall be submitted for consideration which shall be not less than 30 days after the date
412 the notice is published. Such notice shall be published not later than March 1 of the review
413 year. In addition, the agency shall conduct at least two public hearings to receive public
414 comment on its rules. Such public hearings shall be held in a manner designed to
415 maximize public input and shall be completed not later than July 1 of the review year.
416 (e) Agencies that desire to continue their rules in effect shall not simply repromulgate the
417 rules and regulations without critical review of the necessity, effectiveness, and cost of
418 such rules; without considering possible less onerous, less costly, and more effective
419 alternatives to such rules; and without determining whether such rules or regulations are
420 actually necessary.
421 (f) Any rule that an agency desires to continue or repromulgate shall be repromulgated in
422 the same manner as for new rules under this chapter. Any continuation or repromulgation
423 of a rule shall reduce or maintain the current regulatory burden and costs of such rule and
424 shall not increase such burden or costs.
425 (g) The provisions of this Code section shall not apply to constitutional officers or their
426 respective agencies, as such terms are defined in subsection (a) of Code Section 50-13-25.
427 50-13-25.
428 (a) As used in this Code section, the term:

443 the rules promulgated by such constitutional officers, their predecessors, or their respective
444 agencies that are in effect every four years, with the first year of review being the 2028
445 calendar year. In subsequent review years after 2028, each constitutional officer and such
446 officer's respective agency that has, in the intervening years since such last review,
447 decreased the number of its rules by 10 percent or more shall be exempt from review under
448 this Code section during that year of review.
449 (c) All rules of a constitutional officer and such officer's respective agency that are
450 scheduled for review under this Code section shall stand automatically repealed on
451 December 31 of the review year unless the rules are continued or repromulgated pursuant
452 to this Code section.
453 (d) In the year of review, each constitutional officer and such officer's respective agencies
454 shall undertake an analysis of each of its rules and shall create a written report of the results
455 of such analysis. Such analysis shall consider:
- 18 -
25 LC 55 0474S
456 (1) Whether the benefits sought to be achieved by the rule are being realized and are in
457 compliance with current law;
458 (2) Whether such benefits justify the costs of implementing and complying with the
459 provisions of the rule; and
460 (3) Whether there are less restrictive and less costly alternatives to accomplish the
461 desired benefits or results.
462 Such analysis shall be completed not later than September 1 of the year of review. Such
463 analysis shall be published by the constitutional officer on such officer's respective
464 agency's public website upon its completion.
465 (e) As a part of the rules analysis process, each constitutional officer and such officer's
466 respective agency shall solicit public input on the impact, cost, and effectiveness of its
467 rules. The public shall be notified of the opportunity to provide such input in a manner
468 designed to obtain the widest possible public notification of interested parties, as well as
469 by mailing such notice to all persons who have requested in writing that they be placed
470 upon the mailing list maintained by each constitutional officer or such officer's respective
471 agency for advance notice of its rule-making proceedings. The notice shall include a date
472 by which public input shall be submitted for consideration which shall be not less than 30
473 days after the date the notice is published. Such notice shall be published not later than
474 March 1 of the review year. In addition, each constitutional officer and such officer's
475 respective agency shall conduct at least two public hearings to receive public comment on
476 its rules. Such public hearings shall be held in a manner designed to maximize public input
477 and shall be completed not later than July 1 of the review year.
478 (f) Constitutional officers and their respective agencies that desire to continue their rules
479 in effect shall not simply repromulgate the rules and regulations without critical review of
480 the necessity, effectiveness, and cost of such rules; without considering possible less
481 onerous, less costly, and more effective alternatives to such rules; and without determining
482 whether such rules or regulations are actually necessary.
- 19 -
25 LC 55 0474S
483 (g) Any rule that a constitutional officer or such officer's respective agency desires to
484 continue or repromulgate shall be repromulgated in the same manner as for new rules under
485 this chapter. Any continuation or repromulgation of a rule shall reduce or maintain the
486 current regulatory burden and costs of such rule and shall not increase such burden or
487 costs."
488 PART III
489 SECTION 3-1.
490 Title 31 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to health, is amended in Code
491 Section 31-6-21.1, relating to procedures for rule making by the Department of Community
492 Health, by revising subsections (c) and (f) as follows:
493 "(c) Any rule or part thereof to which an objection is made by both committees within the
494 30 day objection period under subsection (b) of this Code section shall not be adopted by
495 the department and shall be invalid if so adopted. A rule or part thereof thus prohibited
496 from being adopted shall be deemed to have been withdrawn by the department unless the
497 department, within the first 15 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly,
498 transmits written notification to each member of the objecting committees that the
499 department does not intend to withdraw that rule or part thereof but intends to adopt the
500 specified rule or part effective the day following adjournment sine die of that regular
501 session. A resolution objecting to such intended adoption may be introduced in either
502 branch house of the General Assembly after the fifteenth day but before the thirtieth day
503 of the session in which occurs the notification of intent not to withdraw a rule or part
504 thereof. In the event the resolution is adopted by the branch house of the General
505 Assembly in which the resolution was introduced, it shall be immediately transmitted to
506 the other branch house of the General Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding
507 officer of the other branch house to have that branch house, within five days after receipt
- 20 -
25 LC 55 0474S
508 of the resolution, consider the resolution for purposes of objecting to the intended adoption
509 of the rule or part thereof. Upon such resolution being adopted by two-thirds of the vote
510 of each branch house of the General Assembly, the rule or part thereof objected to in that
511 resolution shall be disapproved and not adopted by the department. If the resolution is
512 adopted by a majority but by less than two-thirds of the vote of each such branch house,
513 the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her approval or veto. In the
514 event of a veto, or if no resolution is introduced objecting to the rule, or if the resolution
515 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each such branch house, the
516 rule shall automatically become adopted the day following adjournment sine die of that
517 regular session. In the event of the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall be
518 disapproved and not adopted by the department."
519 "(f) Emergency rules shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (b), (c), or (d)
520 of this Code section but shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of Code
521 Section 50-13-4 and subsection (b) of Code Section 50-13-6. Upon the first expiration of
522 any department emergency rules, where those emergency rules are intended to cover
523 matters which had been dealt with by the department's nonemergency rules but such
524 nonemergency rules have been objected to by both legislative committees under this Code
525 section, the emergency rules concerning those matters may not again be adopted except for
526 one 120 day period. No emergency rule or part thereof which is adopted by the department
527 shall be valid unless adopted in compliance with this subsection."
528 SECTION 3-2.
529 Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state government, is amended
530 in Code Section 50-13A-20, relating to applicability of provisions, by revising paragraph (3)
531 of subsection (b) as follows:
532 "(3) Code Section 50-13-6, except for paragraph (2) of subsection (c)(b);"
- 21 -
25 LC 55 0474S
533 PART IV
534 SECTION 4-1.
535 (a) Except as provided for in subsection (b) of this section, this Act shall become effective
536 upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without such approval.
537 (b) Section 2-4 of this Act shall become effective on June 1, 2027.
538 SECTION 4-2.
539 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.

93 SECTION 2-2.
94 Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state government, is amended
95 in Code Section 50-13-4, relating to procedural requirements for adoption, amendment, or
96 repeal of rules, emergency rules, limitation on action to contest rule, and legislative override,
97 by revising subsections (a), (b), (e), and (f) as follows:
98 "(a) Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule, other than interpretive rules
99 or general statements of policy, the agency shall consider the economic impact of the
100 proposed rule and shall:
101 (1) Give at least 30 days' notice of its intended action. The notice shall include an exact
102 copy of the proposed rule and a synopsis of the proposed rule. The synopsis shall be
103 distributed with and in the same manner as the proposed rule. The synopsis shall contain
104 a statement of the purpose and the main features of the proposed rule, and, in the case of
105 a proposed amendatory rule, the synopsis also shall indicate the differences between the
106 existing rule and the proposed rule. The notice shall also include the exact date on which
107 the agency shall consider the adoption of the proposed rule and shall include the time and
108 place in order that interested persons may present their views thereon. The notice shall
109 also contain a citation of the authority pursuant to which the rule is proposed for adoption
110 and, if the proposal is an amendment or repeal of an existing rule, the existing rule shall
111 be clearly identified. For any proposed rule for which the agency reasonably anticipates
- 5 -

25 LC 55 0474S
112 that $1 million or more in cumulative implementation and compliance costs are
113 reasonably expected to be incurred by or passed along to individuals, businesses, and
114 units of local government as the result of the proposed rule over the initial five-year
115 period following the effective date of such proposed rule, the agency shall prepare and
116 there shall be included with the notice an economic analysis of the impact of the proposed
117 rule. If the agency determines that such cumulative implementation and compliance costs
118 of a proposed rule will be less than $1 million over the initial five-year period following
119 the effective date of such proposed rule, the agency shall prepare and there shall be
120 included with the notice a statement explaining the agency's rationale in making such
121 determination. An economic impact analysis required to be prepared by an agency and
122 included in the notice of a proposed rule under this paragraph shall include the following:
123 (A) An estimate, and identification when possible, of the number of individuals,

126 required for compliance with the proposed rule, including the types of professional
127 skills necessary for preparation of any documentation, records, or reports required by
128 the proposed rule;
129 (C) A statement of the probable effect of the rule on impacted individuals, businesses,
130 and units of local government;
131 (D) Whether the proposed rule is mandated by federal law as a requirement for
132 participating in or implementing a federally subsidized or assisted program and whether
133 the proposed rule exceeds the requirements of such applicable federal law;
134 (E) A comparison of the anticipated costs and benefits of the proposed rule;
135 (F) A description of the efforts taken by the agency to minimize the cost and impact
136 of the proposed rule on individuals, businesses, and units of local government in this
137 state; and
- 6 -

25 LC 55 0474S
138 (G) Such other provisions or information the agency deems reasonably necessary for
139 the General Assembly and the public to assess the economic impact of the proposed
140 rule.
141 The notice shall be mailed to all persons who have requested in writing that they be
142 placed upon a mailing list which shall be maintained by the agency for advance notice
143 of its rule-making proceedings and who have tendered the actual cost of such mailing as
144 from time to time estimated by the agency and to the Office of Planning and Budget or
145 other designee of the Governor;
146 (2) Afford to all interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or
147 arguments, orally or in writing. In the case of substantive rules, opportunity for oral
148 hearing must be granted if requested by 25 persons who will be directly affected by the
149 proposed rule, by a governmental subdivision, or by an association having not less
150 than 25 members. The agency shall consider fully all written and oral submissions
151 respecting the proposed rule. Upon adoption of a rule, the agency, if requested to do so
152 by an interested person either prior to adoption or within 30 days thereafter, shall issue
153 a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against its adoption and incorporate
154 therein its reason for overruling the consideration urged against its adoption;
155 (3) In the formulation and adoption of any rule which will have an economic impact on
156 businesses in the state, reduce the economic impact of the rule on small businesses which
157 are independently owned and operated, are not dominant in their field, and
158 employ 100 300 employees or less fewer by implementing one or more of the following
159 actions when it is legal and feasible in meeting the stated objectives of the statutes which
160 are the basis of the proposed rule:
161 (A) Establish differing reduced compliance or reporting requirements or and differing
162 timetables for small businesses;
163 (B) Clarify, consolidate, or simplify the compliance and reporting requirements under
164 the rule for small businesses;
- 7 -

25 LC 55 0474S
165 (C) Establish performance rather than design standards for small businesses; or
166 (D) Exempt small businesses from any or all requirements of the rules;
167 (4) In the formulation and adoption of any rule which places administrative burdens on
168 charitable organizations in this state, including, but not limited to, any rule that would
169 require any new or expanded filing or reporting requirements or that would limit the
170 ability of charitable organizations to solicit or collect funds, the agency or official shall:
171 (A) Absent the showing of a compelling state interest, not impose any annual filing or
172 reporting requirements on an organization regulated or specifically exempted from
173 regulation under Chapter 17 of Title 43, the 'Georgia Charitable Solicitations Act of
174 1988,' that are more burdensome than the requirements authorized by applicable law,
175 and any such filing or reporting requirements shall be narrowly tailored to achieve such
176 compelling state interest. The requirements of this subparagraph shall not apply to the
177 state's direct spending programs; and
178 (B) Email the notice provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection to each
179 chairperson of any standing committee in each house as shown on the General
180 Assembly's public website.
181 For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'charitable organization' means a nonprofit
182 charitable organization which is exempt from taxation under the provisions of
183 Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code; and
184 (5) In the formulation and adoption of any rule, an agency shall choose an alternative
185 that does not impose excessive regulatory costs on any regulated person or entity which
186 costs could be reduced by a less expensive alternative that fully accomplishes the stated
187 objectives of the statutes which are the basis of the proposed rule.
188 (b) If any agency finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare,
189 including, but not limited to, summary processes such as quarantines, contrabands,
190 seizures, and the like authorized by law without notice, requires adoption of a rule,
191 including a rule that would require an economic impact analysis if adopted pursuant to
- 8 -

25 LC 55 0474S
192 subsection (a) of this Code section, upon fewer than 30 days' notice and states in writing
193 its reasons for that finding, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon any
194 abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable to adopt an emergency rule. Any
195 such rule adopted relative to a public health emergency shall be submitted as promptly as
196 reasonably practicable to the House of Representatives and Senate Committees on
197 Judiciary, provided that any such rule adopted relative to a state of emergency by the State
198 Election Board shall be submitted as soon as practicable but not later than 20 days prior to
199 the rule taking effect. Any emergency rule adopted by the State Election Board pursuant
200 to the provisions of this subsection may be suspended upon the majority vote of the House
201 of Representatives or Senate Committees on Judiciary within ten days of the receipt of such
202 rule by the committees. The rule may be effective for a period of not longer than 120 days
203 but adoption of an emergency rule pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall not
204 preclude the adoption of an identical rule under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of
205 this Code section is not precluded; provided, however, that such a rule adopted pursuant
206 to discharge of responsibility under an executive order declaring a state of emergency or
207 disaster exists as a result of a public health emergency, as defined in Code Section 38-3-3,
208 shall be effective for the duration of the emergency or disaster and for a period of not more
209 than 120 days thereafter."
210 "(e)(1) The agency shall transmit the notice provided for in paragraph (1) of
211 subsection (a) of this Code section to the legislative counsel. The notice shall be
212 transmitted at least 30 days prior to the date of the agency's intended action.
213 (2) Within three days after receipt of the notice, if possible, the legislative counsel shall
214 furnish the presiding officers of each house with a copy of the notice, and, except for
215 notices concerning a proposed rule for which an economic impact analysis is required
216 pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section, the presiding officers
217 shall assign the notice to the chairperson of the appropriate standing committee in each
218 house for review and any member thereof who makes a standing written request. In the
- 9 -

25 LC 55 0474S
219 event a presiding officer is unavailable for the purpose of making the assignment within
220 the time limitations, the legislative counsel shall assign the notice to the chairperson of
221 the appropriate standing committee. The legislative counsel shall also transmit within the
222 time limitations provided in this subsection a notice of the assignment to the chairperson
223 of the appropriate standing committee. Each standing committee of the Senate and the
224 House of Representatives is granted all the rights provided for interested persons and
225 governmental subdivisions in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section.
226 (3) For any proposed rule that is adopted by an agency for which an economic impact
227 analysis is required pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section, it
228 shall be the duty of the agency to notify the presiding officers of the Senate and the
229 House of Representatives and the legislative counsel of such adoption within ten days
230 after the adoption of the rule. Such rule may then be considered by the General
231 Assembly as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (f) of this Code section.
232 (f)(1) In the event a standing committee to which a notice is assigned as provided in
233 subsection (e) of this Code section files an objection objects to a proposed rule prior to
234 its adoption and the agency adopts the proposed rule over the objection, the rule may be
235 considered by the branch house of the General Assembly whose committee objected to
236 its adoption by the introduction of a resolution for the purpose of overriding the rule at
237 any time within the first 30 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly. It
238 shall be the duty of any agency which adopts a proposed rule over such objection so to
239 notify the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the
240 chairpersons of the Senate and House committees to which the rule was referred, and the
241 legislative counsel within ten days after the adoption of the rule. In the event the
242 resolution is adopted by such branch house of the General Assembly, it shall be
243 immediately transmitted to the other branch house of the General Assembly. It shall be
244 the duty of the presiding officer of the other branch house of the General Assembly to
245 have such branch house, within five days after the receipt of the resolution, to consider
- 10 -

25 LC 55 0474S
246 the resolution for the purpose of overriding the rule. In the event the resolution is
247 adopted by two-thirds of the votes of each branch house of the General Assembly, the
248 rule shall be void on the day after the adoption of the resolution by the second branch
249 house of the General Assembly. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than
250 two-thirds of the votes of either branch house, the resolution shall be submitted to the
251 Governor for his or her approval or veto. In the event of his or her the Governor's veto,
252 or if no resolution is introduced for the purpose of overriding the rule, or if the resolution
253 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each house of the General
254 Assembly, the rule shall remain in effect adopted and shall become or remain effective
255 in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 50-13-6. In the event of his or her
256 approval the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall be void on the day after
257 the date of his or her approval.
258 (2) In the event each standing committee to which a notice is assigned as provided in
259 subsection (e) of this Code section files an objection objects to a proposed rule prior to
260 its adoption by a two-thirds' vote of the members of the committee who were voting
261 members on the tenth day of the current session, after having given public notice of the
262 time, place, and purpose of such vote at least 48 hours in advance, as well as the
263 opportunity for members of the public, including the promulgating agency, to have a
264 reasonable time to comment on the proposed committee action at the hearing, the
265 effectiveness of such rule shall be stayed until the next legislative session at which time
266 the rule may be considered by the General Assembly by the introduction of a resolution
267 in either branch of the General Assembly for the purpose of overriding the rule at any
268 time within the first 30 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly not be
269 adopted by the promulgating agency and shall instead be deemed withdrawn by the
270 promulgating agency unless such agency, within the first 15 days of the next regular
271 session of the General Assembly, transmits written notification to the chairpersons of the
272 objecting committees that such agency does not intend to withdraw such rule but instead
- 11 -

25 LC 55 0474S
273 intends to adopt such rule following adjournment sine die of that regular session. Such
274 notification shall include a detailed statement setting forth the basis for and necessity of
275 the proposed rule, an explanation of how the adoption of the proposed rule is within the
276 authority of the promulgating agency, any alternatives to the proposed rule considered
277 by the promulgating agency, and the potential costs or adverse effects of the proposed
278 rule, as well as the identification of those likely to bear such costs or adverse effects. A
279 resolution objecting to the intended adoption of the proposed rule may be introduced in
280 either house of the General Assembly after the fifteenth day but before the thirtieth day
281 of the regular session in which the notice of intent not to withdraw the proposed rule was
282 given by the promulgating agency in accordance with this paragraph. In the event the
283 resolution is adopted by the branch house of the General Assembly in which it was
284 introduced, it shall be immediately transmitted to the other branch house of the General
285 Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding officer of the other branch house of the
286 General Assembly to have such branch house, within five days after the receipt of the
287 resolution, to consider the resolution for the purpose of overriding objecting to the
288 intended adoption of the proposed rule. In the event the resolution is adopted by
289 two-thirds of the votes of each branch house of the General Assembly, the proposed rule
290 shall be void on the day after the adoption of the resolution by the second branch of the
291 General Assembly shall be disapproved and shall not be adopted by the promulgating
292 agency. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than two-thirds of the votes of either
293 branch house, the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her approval
294 or veto. In the event of his or her the Governor's veto, the rule shall remain in effect or
295 if no resolution is introduced objecting to the proposed rule, or if the resolution
296 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each house of the General
297 Assembly, the proposed rule shall automatically become adopted the day following
298 adjournment sine die of that regular session and shall become effective in accordance
299 with the provisions of Code Section 50-13-6. In the event of his or her the Governor's
- 12 -

25 LC 55 0474S
300 approval of the resolution, the proposed rule shall be void on the day after the date of his
301 or her approval disapproved and shall not be adopted by the promulgating agency. If
302 after the thirtieth legislative day of the legislative session of which the challenged rule
303 was to be considered the General Assembly has not considered an override of the
304 challenged rule pursuant to this subsection, the rule shall then immediately take effect.
305 (3) Any proposed rule for which an economic impact analysis is required pursuant to
306 paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section that is adopted by an agency may be
307 considered by either house of the General Assembly by the introduction of a resolution
308 for the purpose of ratifying the rule at any time within the first 30 days of the next regular
309 session of the General Assembly. In the event the resolution is adopted by a house of the
310 General Assembly, it shall be immediately transmitted to the other house of the General
311 Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding officer of the other house of the General
312 Assembly to have such house, within five days after the receipt of the resolution, to
313 consider the resolution for the purpose of ratifying the rule. In the event the resolution
314 is adopted by two-thirds of the votes of each house of the General Assembly, the rule
315 shall remain adopted and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of
316 Code Section 50-13-6. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than two-thirds of the
317 votes of either house, the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her
318 approval or veto. In the event of the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall
319 remain adopted and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of Code
320 Section 50-13-6. In the event of the Governor's veto, or if no resolution is introduced for
321 the purpose of ratifying the rule, or if the resolution introduced is not approved by at least
322 a majority of the vote of each house of the General Assembly, the rule shall be void and
323 shall not take effect."

359 filing and shall maintain a record of the rules for public inspection.
360 (c) The 20 day filing period is subject to the following exceptions:

376 subject to the provisions of this chapter, on a four-year cycle, with the first of such reviews
- 15 -

25 LC 55 0474S
377 occurring in the 2028 calendar year. In establishing such schedule, the Office of Planning
378 and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall take into consideration the volume of
379 rules that will be subject to review in any given year and the ability of the public to provide
380 meaningful input into such reviews. An agency that has been through a review under this
381 Code section previously and, in the intervening years since such last review, has decreased
382 the number of its rules by 10 percent or more shall be exempt from review under this Code
383 section during that cycle.
384 (b) The Office of Planning and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall notify in
385 December of the immediately preceding year each agency whose rules are subject to
386 review in a given calendar year of the upcoming review period. All rules of an agency that
387 are scheduled for review under this Code section shall stand automatically repealed on
388 December 31 of the review year unless the rules are continued or repromulgated pursuant
389 to this Code section.
390 (c) In the year of review, each agency shall undertake an analysis of each of its rules and
391 shall create a written report of the results of such analysis. Such analysis shall consider:
392 (1) Whether the benefits sought to be achieved by the rule are being realized and are in
393 compliance with current law;
394 (2) Whether such benefits justify the costs of implementing and complying with the
395 provisions of the rule; and
396 (3) Whether there are less restrictive and less costly alternatives to accomplish the
397 desired benefits or results.
398 The Office of Planning and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall develop and
399 provide to each agency a standardized process and forms for such analysis and shall make
400 such process and forms available on the Office of Planning and Budget's public website not
401 later than October 1, 2027. Such analysis shall be completed not later than September 1
402 of the year of review. Such analysis shall be published on the agency's public website upon
- 16 -

403 its completion and shall be submitted to the Office of Planning and Budget or other
404 designee of the Governor for review.
405 (d) As a part of the rules analysis process, each agency shall solicit public input on the

407 to provide such input in a manner designed to obtain the widest possible public notification
408 of interested parties, as well as by mailing such notice to all persons who have requested
409 in writing that they be placed upon the mailing list maintained by the agency for advance
410 notice of its rule-making proceedings. The notice shall include a date by which public
411 input shall be submitted for consideration which shall be not less than 30 days after the date
412 the notice is published. Such notice shall be published not later than March 1 of the review
413 year. In addition, the agency shall conduct at least two public hearings to receive public
414 comment on its rules. Such public hearings shall be held in a manner designed to
415 maximize public input and shall be completed not later than July 1 of the review year.
416 (e) Agencies that desire to continue their rules in effect shall not simply repromulgate the
417 rules and regulations without critical review of the necessity, effectiveness, and cost of
418 such rules; without considering possible less onerous, less costly, and more effective
419 alternatives to such rules; and without determining whether such rules or regulations are
420 actually necessary.
421 (f) Any rule that an agency desires to continue or repromulgate shall be repromulgated in
422 the same manner as for new rules under this chapter. Any continuation or repromulgation
423 of a rule shall reduce or maintain the current regulatory burden and costs of such rule and
424 shall not increase such burden or costs.
425 (g) The provisions of this Code section shall not apply to constitutional officers or their
426 respective agencies, as such terms are defined in subsection (a) of Code Section 50-13-25.

445 calendar year. In subsequent review years after 2028, each constitutional officer and such
446 officer's respective agency that has, in the intervening years since such last review,
447 decreased the number of its rules by 10 percent or more shall be exempt from review under
448 this Code section during that year of review.
449 (c) All rules of a constitutional officer and such officer's respective agency that are

468 designed to obtain the widest possible public notification of interested parties, as well as
469 by mailing such notice to all persons who have requested in writing that they be placed
470 upon the mailing list maintained by each constitutional officer or such officer's respective
471 agency for advance notice of its rule-making proceedings. The notice shall include a date
472 by which public input shall be submitted for consideration which shall be not less than 30
473 days after the date the notice is published. Such notice shall be published not later than
474 March 1 of the review year. In addition, each constitutional officer and such officer's

478 (f) Constitutional officers and their respective agencies that desire to continue their rules
479 in effect shall not simply repromulgate the rules and regulations without critical review of
480 the necessity, effectiveness, and cost of such rules; without considering possible less
481 onerous, less costly, and more effective alternatives to such rules; and without determining
482 whether such rules or regulations are actually necessary.

483 (g) Any rule that a constitutional officer or such officer's respective agency desires to
484 continue or repromulgate shall be repromulgated in the same manner as for new rules under
485 this chapter. Any continuation or repromulgation of a rule shall reduce or maintain the
486 current regulatory burden and costs of such rule and shall not increase such burden or
487 costs."

489 SECTION 3-1.
490 Title 31 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to health, is amended in Code
491 Section 31-6-21.1, relating to procedures for rule making by the Department of Community
492 Health, by revising subsections (c) and (f) as follows:
493 "(c) Any rule or part thereof to which an objection is made by both committees within the
494 30 day objection period under subsection (b) of this Code section shall not be adopted by
495 the department and shall be invalid if so adopted. A rule or part thereof thus prohibited
496 from being adopted shall be deemed to have been withdrawn by the department unless the
497 department, within the first 15 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly,
498 transmits written notification to each member of the objecting committees that the
499 department does not intend to withdraw that rule or part thereof but intends to adopt the
500 specified rule or part effective the day following adjournment sine die of that regular
501 session. A resolution objecting to such intended adoption may be introduced in either
502 branch house of the General Assembly after the fifteenth day but before the thirtieth day
503 of the session in which occurs the notification of intent not to withdraw a rule or part
504 thereof. In the event the resolution is adopted by the branch house of the General
505 Assembly in which the resolution was introduced, it shall be immediately transmitted to
506 the other branch house of the General Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding
507 officer of the other branch house to have that branch house, within five days after receipt

508 of the resolution, consider the resolution for purposes of objecting to the intended adoption
509 of the rule or part thereof. Upon such resolution being adopted by two-thirds of the vote
510 of each branch house of the General Assembly, the rule or part thereof objected to in that
511 resolution shall be disapproved and not adopted by the department. If the resolution is
512 adopted by a majority but by less than two-thirds of the vote of each such branch house,
513 the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her approval or veto. In the
514 event of a veto, or if no resolution is introduced objecting to the rule, or if the resolution
515 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each such branch house, the
516 rule shall automatically become adopted the day following adjournment sine die of that
517 regular session. In the event of the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall be
518 disapproved and not adopted by the department."
519 "(f) Emergency rules shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (b), (c), or (d)
520 of this Code section but shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of Code
521 Section 50-13-4 and subsection (b) of Code Section 50-13-6. Upon the first expiration of
522 any department emergency rules, where those emergency rules are intended to cover
523 matters which had been dealt with by the department's nonemergency rules but such
524 nonemergency rules have been objected to by both legislative committees under this Code
525 section, the emergency rules concerning those matters may not again be adopted except for
526 one 120 day period. No emergency rule or part thereof which is adopted by the department
527 shall be valid unless adopted in compliance with this subsection."
528 SECTION 3-2.
529 Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state government, is amended
530 in Code Section 50-13A-20, relating to applicability of provisions, by revising paragraph (3)
531 of subsection (b) as follows:
532 "(3) Code Section 50-13-6, except for paragraph (2) of subsection (c)(b);"
