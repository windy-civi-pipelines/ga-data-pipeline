108 proposed rule and shall:
109 (1) Give at least 30 days' notice of its intended action. The notice shall include an exact
110 copy of the proposed rule and a synopsis of the proposed rule. The synopsis shall be

25 LC 50 1234S
112 a statement of the purpose and the main features of the proposed rule, and, in the case of
113 a proposed amendatory rule, the synopsis also shall indicate the differences between the
114 existing rule and the proposed rule. The notice shall also include the exact date on which
115 the agency shall consider the adoption of the proposed rule and shall include the time and
116 place in order that interested persons may present their views thereon. The notice shall
117 also contain a citation of the authority pursuant to which the rule is proposed for adoption
118 and, if the proposal is an amendment or repeal of an existing rule, the existing rule shall
119 be clearly identified. For any proposed rule for which the agency reasonably anticipates
120 that $3 million or more in cumulative implementation and compliance costs are
121 reasonably expected to be incurred by or passed along to individuals, businesses, and
122 units of local government as the result of the proposed rule over the initial five-year
123 period following the effective date of such proposed rule, the agency shall prepare and
124 there shall be included with the notice an economic analysis of the impact of the proposed
125 rule; provided, however, that no economic impact analysis shall be required of any
126 proposed rule or amendment that is mandated by federal law or agency regulation or is
127 a requirement for participating in or implementing a federally subsidized or assisted
128 program. If the agency determines that such cumulative implementation and compliance
129 costs of a proposed rule will be less than $3 million over the initial five-year period
130 following the effective date of such proposed rule or if the proposed rule is mandated by
131 federal law, the agency shall prepare and there shall be included with the notice a
132 statement explaining the agency's rationale in making such determination or citing the
133 federal authority that requires such proposed rule. An economic impact analysis required
134 to be prepared by an agency and included in the notice of a proposed rule under this
135 paragraph shall include the following:
136 (A) An estimate, and identification when possible, of the number of individuals,
137 businesses, and units of local government subject to the proposed rule;

139 required for compliance with the proposed rule, including the types of professional
140 skills necessary for preparation of any documentation, records, or reports required by
141 the proposed rule;
142 (C) A statement of the probable effect of the rule on impacted individuals, businesses,
143 and units of local government;
144 (D) A comparison of the anticipated costs and benefits of the proposed rule;
145 (E) A description of the efforts taken by the agency to minimize the cost and impact
146 of the proposed rule on individuals, businesses, and units of local government in this
147 state; and
148 (F) Such other provisions or information the agency deems reasonably necessary for
149 the General Assembly and the public to assess the economic impact of the proposed
150 rule.
151 The notice shall be mailed to all persons who have requested in writing that they be
152 placed upon a mailing list which shall be maintained by the agency for advance notice
153 of its rule-making proceedings and who have tendered the actual cost of such mailing as
154 from time to time estimated by the agency and to the Office of Planning and Budget or
155 other designee of the Governor;
156 (2) Afford to all interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or
157 arguments, orally or in writing. In the case of substantive rules, opportunity for oral
158 hearing must be granted if requested by 25 persons who will be directly affected by the
159 proposed rule, by a governmental subdivision, or by an association having not less
160 than 25 members. The agency shall consider fully all written and oral submissions
161 respecting the proposed rule. Upon adoption of a rule, the agency, if requested to do so
162 by an interested person either prior to adoption or within 30 days thereafter, shall issue
163 a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against its adoption and incorporate
164 therein its reason for overruling the consideration urged against its adoption;

165 (3) In the formulation and adoption of any rule which will have an economic impact on
166 businesses in the state, reduce the economic impact of the rule on small businesses which
167 are independently owned and operated, are not dominant in their field, and
168 employ 100 300 employees or less fewer by implementing one or more of the following
169 actions when it is legal and feasible in meeting the stated objectives of the statutes which
170 are the basis of the proposed rule:
171 (A) Establish differing reduced compliance or reporting requirements or and differing
172 timetables for small businesses;
173 (B) Clarify, consolidate, or simplify the compliance and reporting requirements under
174 the rule for small businesses;
175 (C) Establish performance rather than design standards for small businesses; or
176 (D) Exempt small businesses from any or all requirements of the rules;
177 (4) In the formulation and adoption of any rule which places administrative burdens on
178 charitable organizations in this state, including, but not limited to, any rule that would
179 require any new or expanded filing or reporting requirements or that would limit the
180 ability of charitable organizations to solicit or collect funds, the agency or official shall:
181 (A) Absent the showing of a compelling state interest, not impose any annual filing or
182 reporting requirements on an organization regulated or specifically exempted from
183 regulation under Chapter 17 of Title 43, the 'Georgia Charitable Solicitations Act of
184 1988,' that are more burdensome than the requirements authorized by applicable law,
185 and any such filing or reporting requirements shall be narrowly tailored to achieve such
186 compelling state interest. The requirements of this subparagraph shall not apply to the
187 state's direct spending programs; and
188 (B) Email the notice provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection to each
189 chairperson of any standing committee in each house as shown on the General
190 Assembly's public website.

191 For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'charitable organization' means a nonprofit
192 charitable organization which is exempt from taxation under the provisions of
193 Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code; and
194 (5) In the formulation and adoption of any rule, an agency shall choose an alternative
195 that does not impose excessive regulatory costs on any regulated person or entity which
196 costs could be reduced by a less expensive alternative that fully accomplishes the stated
197 objectives of the statutes which are the basis of the proposed rule.
198 (b) If any agency finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare,
199 including, but not limited to, summary processes such as quarantines, contrabands,
200 seizures, and the like authorized by law without notice, requires adoption of a rule,
201 including a rule that would require an economic impact analysis if adopted pursuant to
202 subsection (a) of this Code section, upon fewer than 30 days' notice and states in writing
203 its reasons for that finding, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon any
204 abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable to adopt an emergency rule. Any
205 such rule adopted relative to a public health emergency shall be submitted as promptly as
206 reasonably practicable to the House of Representatives and Senate Committees on
207 Judiciary, provided that any such rule adopted relative to a state of emergency by the State
208 Election Board shall be submitted as soon as practicable but not later than 20 days prior to
209 the rule taking effect. Any emergency rule adopted by the State Election Board pursuant
210 to the provisions of this subsection may be suspended upon the majority vote of the House
211 of Representatives or Senate Committees on Judiciary within ten days of the receipt of such
212 rule by the committees. The rule may be effective for a period of not longer than 120 days
213 but adoption of an emergency rule pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall not
214 preclude the adoption of an identical rule under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of
215 this Code section is not precluded; provided, however, that such a rule adopted pursuant
216 to discharge of responsibility under an executive order declaring a state of emergency or
217 disaster exists as a result of a public health emergency, as defined in Code Section 38-3-3,
S. B. 28 (SUB)

218 shall be effective for the duration of the emergency or disaster and for a period of not more
219 than 120 days thereafter."
220 "(e)(1) The agency shall transmit the notice provided for in paragraph (1) of
221 subsection (a) of this Code section to the legislative counsel. The notice shall be
222 transmitted at least 30 days prior to the date of the agency's intended action.
223 (2) Within three days after receipt of the notice, if possible, the legislative counsel shall
224 furnish the presiding officers of each house with a copy of the notice, and, except for
225 notices concerning a proposed rule for which an economic impact analysis is required
226 pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section, which shall be forwarded
227 to the chairpersons of the House Committee on Budget and Fiscal Affairs Oversight and
228 the Senate Committee on Government Oversight, the presiding officers shall assign the
229 notice to the chairperson of the appropriate standing committee in each house for review
230 and any member thereof who makes a standing written request. In the event a presiding
231 officer is unavailable for the purpose of making the assignment within the time
232 limitations, the legislative counsel shall assign the notice to the chairperson of the
233 appropriate standing committee. The legislative counsel shall also transmit within the
234 time limitations provided in this subsection a notice of the assignment to the chairperson
235 of the appropriate standing committee. Each standing committee of the Senate and the
236 House of Representatives is granted all the rights provided for interested persons and
237 governmental subdivisions in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section.
238 (3) For any proposed rule that is adopted by an agency for which an economic impact
239 analysis is required pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section, it
240 shall be the duty of the agency to notify the presiding officers of the Senate and the
241 House of Representatives, the chairpersons of the House Committee on Budget and Fiscal
242 Affairs Oversight and the Senate Committee on Government Oversight, and the
243 legislative counsel of such adoption within ten days after the adoption of the rule. Such
S. B. 28 (SUB)
- 10 -
25 LC 50 1234S
244 rule may then be considered by the General Assembly as provided in paragraph (3) of
245 subsection (f) of this Code section.
246 (f)(1) In the event a standing committee to which a notice is assigned as provided in
247 subsection (e) of this Code section files an objection objects to a proposed rule prior to
248 its adoption and the agency adopts the proposed rule over the objection, the rule may be
249 considered by the branch house of the General Assembly whose committee objected to
250 its adoption by the introduction of a resolution for the purpose of overriding the rule at
251 any time within the first 30 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly. It
252 shall be the duty of any agency which adopts a proposed rule over such objection so to
253 notify the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the
254 chairpersons of the Senate and House committees to which the rule was referred, and the
255 legislative counsel within ten days after the adoption of the rule. In the event the
256 resolution is adopted by such branch house of the General Assembly, it shall be
257 immediately transmitted to the other branch house of the General Assembly. It shall be
258 the duty of the presiding officer of the other branch house of the General Assembly to
259 have such branch house, within five days after the receipt of the resolution, to consider
260 the resolution for the purpose of overriding the rule. In the event the resolution is
261 adopted by two-thirds of the votes of each branch house of the General Assembly, the
262 rule shall be void on the day after the adoption of the resolution by the second branch
263 house of the General Assembly. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than
264 two-thirds of the votes of either branch house, the resolution shall be submitted to the
265 Governor for his or her approval or veto. In the event of his or her the Governor's veto,
266 or if no resolution is introduced for the purpose of overriding the rule, or if the resolution
267 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each house of the General
268 Assembly, the rule shall remain in effect adopted and shall become or remain effective
269 in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 50-13-6. In the event of his or her

270 approval the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall be void on the day after
271 the date of his or her approval.
272 (2) In the event each standing committee to which a notice is assigned as provided in
273 subsection (e) of this Code section files an objection objects to a proposed rule prior to
274 its adoption by a two-thirds' vote of the members of the committee who were voting
275 members on the tenth day of the current session, after having given public notice of the
276 time, place, and purpose of such vote at least 48 hours in advance, as well as the
277 opportunity for members of the public, including the promulgating agency, to have a
278 reasonable time to comment on the proposed committee action at the hearing, the
279 effectiveness of such rule shall be stayed until the next legislative session at which time
280 the rule may be considered by the General Assembly by the introduction of a resolution
281 in either branch of the General Assembly for the purpose of overriding the rule at any
282 time within the first 30 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly not be
283 adopted by the promulgating agency and shall instead be deemed withdrawn by the
284 promulgating agency unless such agency, within the first 15 days of the next regular
285 session of the General Assembly, transmits written notification to the chairpersons of the
286 objecting committees that such agency does not intend to withdraw such rule but instead
287 intends to adopt such rule following adjournment sine die of that regular session. Such
288 notification shall include a detailed statement setting forth the basis for and necessity of
289 the proposed rule, an explanation of how the adoption of the proposed rule is within the
290 authority of the promulgating agency, any alternatives to the proposed rule considered
291 by the promulgating agency, and the potential costs or adverse effects of the proposed
292 rule, as well as the identification of those likely to bear such costs or adverse effects. A
293 resolution objecting to the intended adoption of the proposed rule may be introduced in
294 either house of the General Assembly after the fifteenth day but before the thirtieth day
295 of the regular session in which the notice of intent not to withdraw the proposed rule was
296 given by the promulgating agency in accordance with this paragraph. In the event the
S. B. 28 (SUB)
- 12 -
25 LC 50 1234S
297 resolution is adopted by the branch house of the General Assembly in which it was
298 introduced, it shall be immediately transmitted to the other branch house of the General
299 Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding officer of the other branch house of the
300 General Assembly to have such branch house, within five days after the receipt of the
301 resolution, to consider the resolution for the purpose of overriding objecting to the
302 intended adoption of the proposed rule. In the event the resolution is adopted by
303 two-thirds of the votes of each branch house of the General Assembly, the proposed rule
304 shall be void on the day after the adoption of the resolution by the second branch of the
305 General Assembly shall be disapproved and shall not be adopted by the promulgating
306 agency. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than two-thirds of the votes of either
307 branch house, the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her approval
308 or veto. In the event of his or her the Governor's veto, the rule shall remain in effect or
309 if no resolution is introduced objecting to the proposed rule, or if the resolution
310 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each house of the General
311 Assembly, the proposed rule shall automatically become adopted the day following
312 adjournment sine die of that regular session and shall become effective in accordance
313 with the provisions of Code Section 50-13-6. In the event of his or her the Governor's
314 approval of the resolution, the proposed rule shall be void on the day after the date of his
315 or her approval disapproved and shall not be adopted by the promulgating agency. If
316 after the thirtieth legislative day of the legislative session of which the challenged rule
317 was to be considered the General Assembly has not considered an override of the
318 challenged rule pursuant to this subsection, the rule shall then immediately take effect.
319 (3) Any proposed rule for which an economic impact analysis is required pursuant to
320 paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section that is adopted by an agency may be
321 considered by either house of the General Assembly by the introduction of a resolution
322 for the purpose of ratifying the rule at any time within the first 30 days of the next regular
323 session of the General Assembly. In the event the resolution is adopted by a house of the
S. B. 28 (SUB)
- 13 -
25 LC 50 1234S
324 General Assembly, it shall be immediately transmitted to the other house of the General
325 Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding officer of the other house of the General
326 Assembly to have such house, within five days after the receipt of the resolution, to
327 consider the resolution for the purpose of ratifying the rule. In the event the resolution
328 is adopted by two-thirds of the votes of each house of the General Assembly, the rule
329 shall remain adopted and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of
330 Code Section 50-13-6. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than two-thirds of the
331 votes of either house, the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her
332 approval or veto. In the event of the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall
333 remain adopted and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of Code
334 Section 50-13-6. In the event of the Governor's veto, or if no resolution is introduced for
335 the purpose of ratifying the rule, or if the resolution introduced is not approved by at least
336 a majority of the vote of each house of the General Assembly, the rule shall be void and

385 SECTION 2-4.
386 Said title is further amended by adding new Code sections to read as follows:
387 "50-13-24.
388 (a) Not later than July 1, 2027, the Office of Planning and Budget or other designee of the
389 Governor shall establish and publish a schedule for the review of the rules of all agencies,
390 subject to the provisions of this chapter, on a four-year cycle, with the first of such reviews
391 occurring in the 2028 calendar year. In establishing such schedule, the Office of Planning
392 and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall take into consideration the volume of
393 rules that will be subject to review in any given year and the ability of the public to provide
394 meaningful input into such reviews. An agency that has been through a review under this
395 Code section previously and, in the intervening years since such last review, has decreased
396 the number of its rules by 10 percent or more shall be exempt from review under this Code
397 section during that cycle.
398 (b) The Office of Planning and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall notify in
399 December of the immediately preceding year each agency whose rules are subject to
400 review in a given calendar year of the upcoming review period. All rules of an agency that
401 are scheduled for review under this Code section shall stand automatically repealed on
S. B. 28 (SUB)
- 16 -
25 LC 50 1234S
402 December 31 of the review year unless the rules are continued or repromulgated pursuant
403 to this Code section.
404 (c) In the year of review, each agency shall undertake an analysis of each of its rules and
405 shall create a written report of the results of such analysis. Such analysis shall consider:
406 (1) Whether the benefits sought to be achieved by the rule are being realized and are in
407 compliance with current law;
408 (2) Whether such benefits justify the costs of implementing and complying with the
409 provisions of the rule;
410 (3) Whether there are less restrictive and less costly alternatives to accomplish the
411 desired benefits or results; and
412 (4) Whether the rule is mandated by federal law as a requirement for participating in or
413 implementing a federally subsidized or assisted program and whether the proposed rule
414 exceeds the requirements of such applicable federal law.
415 The Office of Planning and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall develop and
416 provide to each agency a standardized process and forms for such analysis and shall make
417 such process and forms available on the Office of Planning and Budget's public website not
418 later than October 1, 2027. Such analysis shall be completed not later than September 1
419 of the year of review. Such analysis shall be published on the agency's public website upon
420 its completion and shall be submitted for review to the Office of Planning and Budget or
421 other designee of the Governor, the chairperson of the House Committee on Budget and
422 Fiscal Affairs Oversight, and the chairperson of the Senate Committee on Government
423 Oversight.
424 (d) As a part of the rules analysis process, each agency shall solicit public input on the
425 impact, cost, and effectiveness of its rules. The public shall be notified of the opportunity
426 to provide such input in a manner designed to obtain the widest possible public notification
427 of interested parties, as well as by mailing such notice to all persons who have requested
428 in writing that they be placed upon the mailing list maintained by the agency for advance
S. B. 28 (SUB)

429 notice of its rule-making proceedings. The notice shall include a date by which public
430 input shall be submitted for consideration which shall be not less than 30 days after the date
431 the notice is published. Such notice shall be published not later than March 1 of the review
432 year. In addition, the agency shall conduct at least two public hearings to receive public
433 comment on its rules. Such public hearings shall be held in a manner designed to
434 maximize public input and shall be completed not later than July 1 of the review year.
435 (e) Agencies that desire to continue their rules in effect shall not simply repromulgate the
436 rules and regulations without critical review of the necessity, effectiveness, and cost of
437 such rules; without considering possible less onerous, less costly, and more effective
438 alternatives to such rules; and without determining whether such rules or regulations are
439 actually necessary.
440 (f) Any rule that an agency desires to continue or repromulgate shall be repromulgated in
441 the same manner as for new rules under this chapter. Any continuation or repromulgation
442 of a rule shall reduce or maintain the current regulatory burden and costs of such rule and
443 shall not increase such burden or costs.
444 (g) The provisions of this Code section shall not apply to constitutional officers or their
445 respective agencies, as such terms are defined in subsection (a) of Code Section 50-13-25.
446 50-13-25.

462 the rules promulgated by such constitutional officers, their predecessors, or their respective
463 agencies that are in effect every four years, with the first year of review being the 2028
464 calendar year. In subsequent review years after 2028, each constitutional officer and such
465 officer's respective agency that has, in the intervening years since such last review,
466 decreased the number of its rules by 10 percent or more shall be exempt from review under
467 this Code section during that year of review.
468 (c) All rules of a constitutional officer and such officer's respective agency that are
469 scheduled for review under this Code section shall stand automatically repealed on
470 December 31 of the review year unless the rules are continued or repromulgated pursuant
471 to this Code section.
472 (d) In the year of review, each constitutional officer and such officer's respective agencies
473 shall undertake an analysis of each of its rules and shall create a written report of the results
474 of such analysis. Such analysis shall consider:
475 (1) Whether the benefits sought to be achieved by the rule are being realized and are in
476 compliance with current law;
477 (2) Whether such benefits justify the costs of implementing and complying with the
478 provisions of the rule; and
479 (3) Whether there are less restrictive and less costly alternatives to accomplish the
480 desired benefits or results.

485 on Government Oversight.
486 (e) As a part of the rules analysis process, each constitutional officer and such officer's

489 designed to obtain the widest possible public notification of interested parties, as well as
490 by mailing such notice to all persons who have requested in writing that they be placed
491 upon the mailing list maintained by each constitutional officer or such officer's respective
492 agency for advance notice of its rule-making proceedings. The notice shall include a date
493 by which public input shall be submitted for consideration which shall be not less than 30
494 days after the date the notice is published. Such notice shall be published not later than
495 March 1 of the review year. In addition, each constitutional officer and such officer's
496 respective agency shall conduct at least two public hearings to receive public comment on
497 its rules. Such public hearings shall be held in a manner designed to maximize public input
498 and shall be completed not later than July 1 of the review year.
499 (f) Constitutional officers and their respective agencies that desire to continue their rules
500 in effect shall not simply repromulgate the rules and regulations without critical review of

503 whether such rules or regulations are actually necessary.
504 (g) Any rule that a constitutional officer or such officer's respective agency desires to

511 Section 31-6-21.1, relating to procedures for rule making by the Department of Community
512 Health, by revising subsections (c) and (f) as follows:
513 "(c) Any rule or part thereof to which an objection is made by both committees within the
514 30 day objection period under subsection (b) of this Code section shall not be adopted by
515 the department and shall be invalid if so adopted. A rule or part thereof thus prohibited
516 from being adopted shall be deemed to have been withdrawn by the department unless the
517 department, within the first 15 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly,
518 transmits written notification to each member of the objecting committees that the
519 department does not intend to withdraw that rule or part thereof but intends to adopt the
520 specified rule or part effective the day following adjournment sine die of that regular
521 session. A resolution objecting to such intended adoption may be introduced in either
522 branch house of the General Assembly after the fifteenth day but before the thirtieth day
523 of the session in which occurs the notification of intent not to withdraw a rule or part
524 thereof. In the event the resolution is adopted by the branch house of the General
525 Assembly in which the resolution was introduced, it shall be immediately transmitted to
526 the other branch house of the General Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding
527 officer of the other branch house to have that branch house, within five days after receipt
528 of the resolution, consider the resolution for purposes of objecting to the intended adoption
529 of the rule or part thereof. Upon such resolution being adopted by two-thirds of the vote
530 of each branch house of the General Assembly, the rule or part thereof objected to in that
531 resolution shall be disapproved and not adopted by the department. If the resolution is
S. B. 28 (SUB)
- 21 -
25 LC 50 1234S
532 adopted by a majority but by less than two-thirds of the vote of each such branch house,
533 the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her approval or veto. In the
534 event of a veto, or if no resolution is introduced objecting to the rule, or if the resolution
535 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each such branch house, the
536 rule shall automatically become adopted the day following adjournment sine die of that
537 regular session. In the event of the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall be
538 disapproved and not adopted by the department."
539 "(f) Emergency rules shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (b), (c), or (d)
540 of this Code section but shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of Code
541 Section 50-13-4 and subsection (b) of Code Section 50-13-6. Upon the first expiration of
542 any department emergency rules, where those emergency rules are intended to cover
543 matters which had been dealt with by the department's nonemergency rules but such
544 nonemergency rules have been objected to by both legislative committees under this Code
545 section, the emergency rules concerning those matters may not again be adopted except for
546 one 120 day period. No emergency rule or part thereof which is adopted by the department
547 shall be valid unless adopted in compliance with this subsection."
548 SECTION 3-2.
549 Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state government, is amended
550 in Code Section 50-13A-20, relating to applicability of provisions, by revising paragraph (3)

553 PART IV
554 SECTION 4-1.
555 (a) Except as provided for in subsection (b) of this section, this Act shall become effective
556 upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without such approval.
557 (b) Section 2-4 of this Act shall become effective on June 1, 2027.

104 repeal of rules, emergency rules, limitation on action to contest rule, and legislative override,
105 by revising subsections (a), (b), (e), and (f) as follows:
106 "(a) Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule, other than interpretive rules
107 or general statements of policy, the agency shall consider the economic impact of the
108 proposed rule and shall:
109 (1) Give at least 30 days' notice of its intended action. The notice shall include an exact
110 copy of the proposed rule and a synopsis of the proposed rule. The synopsis shall be
111 distributed with and in the same manner as the proposed rule. The synopsis shall contain
S. B. 28 (SUB)

25 LC 50 1234S
112 a statement of the purpose and the main features of the proposed rule, and, in the case of
113 a proposed amendatory rule, the synopsis also shall indicate the differences between the
114 existing rule and the proposed rule. The notice shall also include the exact date on which
115 the agency shall consider the adoption of the proposed rule and shall include the time and
116 place in order that interested persons may present their views thereon. The notice shall
117 also contain a citation of the authority pursuant to which the rule is proposed for adoption
118 and, if the proposal is an amendment or repeal of an existing rule, the existing rule shall
119 be clearly identified. For any proposed rule for which the agency reasonably anticipates
120 that $3 million or more in cumulative implementation and compliance costs are
121 reasonably expected to be incurred by or passed along to individuals, businesses, and
122 units of local government as the result of the proposed rule over the initial five-year
123 period following the effective date of such proposed rule, the agency shall prepare and
124 there shall be included with the notice an economic analysis of the impact of the proposed
125 rule; provided, however, that no economic impact analysis shall be required of any
126 proposed rule or amendment that is mandated by federal law or agency regulation or is
127 a requirement for participating in or implementing a federally subsidized or assisted
128 program. If the agency determines that such cumulative implementation and compliance
129 costs of a proposed rule will be less than $3 million over the initial five-year period
130 following the effective date of such proposed rule or if the proposed rule is mandated by
131 federal law, the agency shall prepare and there shall be included with the notice a
132 statement explaining the agency's rationale in making such determination or citing the
133 federal authority that requires such proposed rule. An economic impact analysis required
134 to be prepared by an agency and included in the notice of a proposed rule under this
135 paragraph shall include the following:
136 (A) An estimate, and identification when possible, of the number of individuals,
137 businesses, and units of local government subject to the proposed rule;
S. B. 28 (SUB)

25 LC 50 1234S
138 (B) The projected reporting, record keeping, and other administrative costs and time
139 required for compliance with the proposed rule, including the types of professional
140 skills necessary for preparation of any documentation, records, or reports required by
141 the proposed rule;
142 (C) A statement of the probable effect of the rule on impacted individuals, businesses,
143 and units of local government;
144 (D) A comparison of the anticipated costs and benefits of the proposed rule;
145 (E) A description of the efforts taken by the agency to minimize the cost and impact
146 of the proposed rule on individuals, businesses, and units of local government in this
147 state; and
148 (F) Such other provisions or information the agency deems reasonably necessary for
149 the General Assembly and the public to assess the economic impact of the proposed
150 rule.
151 The notice shall be mailed to all persons who have requested in writing that they be
152 placed upon a mailing list which shall be maintained by the agency for advance notice
153 of its rule-making proceedings and who have tendered the actual cost of such mailing as
154 from time to time estimated by the agency and to the Office of Planning and Budget or
155 other designee of the Governor;
156 (2) Afford to all interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or
157 arguments, orally or in writing. In the case of substantive rules, opportunity for oral
158 hearing must be granted if requested by 25 persons who will be directly affected by the
159 proposed rule, by a governmental subdivision, or by an association having not less
160 than 25 members. The agency shall consider fully all written and oral submissions
161 respecting the proposed rule. Upon adoption of a rule, the agency, if requested to do so
162 by an interested person either prior to adoption or within 30 days thereafter, shall issue
163 a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against its adoption and incorporate
164 therein its reason for overruling the consideration urged against its adoption;

165 (3) In the formulation and adoption of any rule which will have an economic impact on
166 businesses in the state, reduce the economic impact of the rule on small businesses which
167 are independently owned and operated, are not dominant in their field, and
168 employ 100 300 employees or less fewer by implementing one or more of the following
169 actions when it is legal and feasible in meeting the stated objectives of the statutes which
170 are the basis of the proposed rule:
171 (A) Establish differing reduced compliance or reporting requirements or and differing
172 timetables for small businesses;
173 (B) Clarify, consolidate, or simplify the compliance and reporting requirements under
174 the rule for small businesses;
175 (C) Establish performance rather than design standards for small businesses; or
176 (D) Exempt small businesses from any or all requirements of the rules;
177 (4) In the formulation and adoption of any rule which places administrative burdens on
178 charitable organizations in this state, including, but not limited to, any rule that would
179 require any new or expanded filing or reporting requirements or that would limit the
180 ability of charitable organizations to solicit or collect funds, the agency or official shall:
181 (A) Absent the showing of a compelling state interest, not impose any annual filing or
182 reporting requirements on an organization regulated or specifically exempted from
183 regulation under Chapter 17 of Title 43, the 'Georgia Charitable Solicitations Act of
184 1988,' that are more burdensome than the requirements authorized by applicable law,
185 and any such filing or reporting requirements shall be narrowly tailored to achieve such
186 compelling state interest. The requirements of this subparagraph shall not apply to the
187 state's direct spending programs; and
188 (B) Email the notice provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection to each
189 chairperson of any standing committee in each house as shown on the General
190 Assembly's public website.

191 For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'charitable organization' means a nonprofit
192 charitable organization which is exempt from taxation under the provisions of
193 Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code; and
194 (5) In the formulation and adoption of any rule, an agency shall choose an alternative
195 that does not impose excessive regulatory costs on any regulated person or entity which
196 costs could be reduced by a less expensive alternative that fully accomplishes the stated
197 objectives of the statutes which are the basis of the proposed rule.
198 (b) If any agency finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare,
199 including, but not limited to, summary processes such as quarantines, contrabands,
200 seizures, and the like authorized by law without notice, requires adoption of a rule,
201 including a rule that would require an economic impact analysis if adopted pursuant to
202 subsection (a) of this Code section, upon fewer than 30 days' notice and states in writing
203 its reasons for that finding, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon any
204 abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable to adopt an emergency rule. Any
205 such rule adopted relative to a public health emergency shall be submitted as promptly as
206 reasonably practicable to the House of Representatives and Senate Committees on
207 Judiciary, provided that any such rule adopted relative to a state of emergency by the State
208 Election Board shall be submitted as soon as practicable but not later than 20 days prior to
209 the rule taking effect. Any emergency rule adopted by the State Election Board pursuant
210 to the provisions of this subsection may be suspended upon the majority vote of the House
211 of Representatives or Senate Committees on Judiciary within ten days of the receipt of such
212 rule by the committees. The rule may be effective for a period of not longer than 120 days
213 but adoption of an emergency rule pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall not
214 preclude the adoption of an identical rule under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of
215 this Code section is not precluded; provided, however, that such a rule adopted pursuant
216 to discharge of responsibility under an executive order declaring a state of emergency or
217 disaster exists as a result of a public health emergency, as defined in Code Section 38-3-3,
S. B. 28 (SUB)

218 shall be effective for the duration of the emergency or disaster and for a period of not more
219 than 120 days thereafter."
220 "(e)(1) The agency shall transmit the notice provided for in paragraph (1) of
221 subsection (a) of this Code section to the legislative counsel. The notice shall be
222 transmitted at least 30 days prior to the date of the agency's intended action.
223 (2) Within three days after receipt of the notice, if possible, the legislative counsel shall
224 furnish the presiding officers of each house with a copy of the notice, and, except for
225 notices concerning a proposed rule for which an economic impact analysis is required
226 pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section, which shall be forwarded
227 to the chairpersons of the House Committee on Budget and Fiscal Affairs Oversight and
228 the Senate Committee on Government Oversight, the presiding officers shall assign the
229 notice to the chairperson of the appropriate standing committee in each house for review
230 and any member thereof who makes a standing written request. In the event a presiding
231 officer is unavailable for the purpose of making the assignment within the time
232 limitations, the legislative counsel shall assign the notice to the chairperson of the
233 appropriate standing committee. The legislative counsel shall also transmit within the
234 time limitations provided in this subsection a notice of the assignment to the chairperson
235 of the appropriate standing committee. Each standing committee of the Senate and the
236 House of Representatives is granted all the rights provided for interested persons and
237 governmental subdivisions in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section.
238 (3) For any proposed rule that is adopted by an agency for which an economic impact
239 analysis is required pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section, it
240 shall be the duty of the agency to notify the presiding officers of the Senate and the
241 House of Representatives, the chairpersons of the House Committee on Budget and Fiscal
242 Affairs Oversight and the Senate Committee on Government Oversight, and the
243 legislative counsel of such adoption within ten days after the adoption of the rule. Such

244 rule may then be considered by the General Assembly as provided in paragraph (3) of
245 subsection (f) of this Code section.
246 (f)(1) In the event a standing committee to which a notice is assigned as provided in
247 subsection (e) of this Code section files an objection objects to a proposed rule prior to
248 its adoption and the agency adopts the proposed rule over the objection, the rule may be
249 considered by the branch house of the General Assembly whose committee objected to
250 its adoption by the introduction of a resolution for the purpose of overriding the rule at
251 any time within the first 30 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly. It
252 shall be the duty of any agency which adopts a proposed rule over such objection so to
253 notify the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the
254 chairpersons of the Senate and House committees to which the rule was referred, and the
255 legislative counsel within ten days after the adoption of the rule. In the event the
256 resolution is adopted by such branch house of the General Assembly, it shall be
257 immediately transmitted to the other branch house of the General Assembly. It shall be
258 the duty of the presiding officer of the other branch house of the General Assembly to
259 have such branch house, within five days after the receipt of the resolution, to consider

262 rule shall be void on the day after the adoption of the resolution by the second branch
263 house of the General Assembly. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than
264 two-thirds of the votes of either branch house, the resolution shall be submitted to the
265 Governor for his or her approval or veto. In the event of his or her the Governor's veto,
266 or if no resolution is introduced for the purpose of overriding the rule, or if the resolution
267 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each house of the General
268 Assembly, the rule shall remain in effect adopted and shall become or remain effective
269 in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 50-13-6. In the event of his or her

271 the date of his or her approval.
272 (2) In the event each standing committee to which a notice is assigned as provided in
273 subsection (e) of this Code section files an objection objects to a proposed rule prior to
274 its adoption by a two-thirds' vote of the members of the committee who were voting
275 members on the tenth day of the current session, after having given public notice of the
276 time, place, and purpose of such vote at least 48 hours in advance, as well as the
277 opportunity for members of the public, including the promulgating agency, to have a
278 reasonable time to comment on the proposed committee action at the hearing, the
279 effectiveness of such rule shall be stayed until the next legislative session at which time
280 the rule may be considered by the General Assembly by the introduction of a resolution
281 in either branch of the General Assembly for the purpose of overriding the rule at any
282 time within the first 30 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly not be
283 adopted by the promulgating agency and shall instead be deemed withdrawn by the
284 promulgating agency unless such agency, within the first 15 days of the next regular
285 session of the General Assembly, transmits written notification to the chairpersons of the
286 objecting committees that such agency does not intend to withdraw such rule but instead
287 intends to adopt such rule following adjournment sine die of that regular session. Such
288 notification shall include a detailed statement setting forth the basis for and necessity of
289 the proposed rule, an explanation of how the adoption of the proposed rule is within the
290 authority of the promulgating agency, any alternatives to the proposed rule considered
291 by the promulgating agency, and the potential costs or adverse effects of the proposed
292 rule, as well as the identification of those likely to bear such costs or adverse effects. A
293 resolution objecting to the intended adoption of the proposed rule may be introduced in
294 either house of the General Assembly after the fifteenth day but before the thirtieth day
295 of the regular session in which the notice of intent not to withdraw the proposed rule was
296 given by the promulgating agency in accordance with this paragraph. In the event the

299 Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding officer of the other branch house of the
300 General Assembly to have such branch house, within five days after the receipt of the
301 resolution, to consider the resolution for the purpose of overriding objecting to the
302 intended adoption of the proposed rule. In the event the resolution is adopted by
303 two-thirds of the votes of each branch house of the General Assembly, the proposed rule
304 shall be void on the day after the adoption of the resolution by the second branch of the
305 General Assembly shall be disapproved and shall not be adopted by the promulgating
306 agency. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than two-thirds of the votes of either
307 branch house, the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her approval
308 or veto. In the event of his or her the Governor's veto, the rule shall remain in effect or
309 if no resolution is introduced objecting to the proposed rule, or if the resolution
310 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each house of the General
311 Assembly, the proposed rule shall automatically become adopted the day following
312 adjournment sine die of that regular session and shall become effective in accordance
313 with the provisions of Code Section 50-13-6. In the event of his or her the Governor's
314 approval of the resolution, the proposed rule shall be void on the day after the date of his
315 or her approval disapproved and shall not be adopted by the promulgating agency. If
316 after the thirtieth legislative day of the legislative session of which the challenged rule
317 was to be considered the General Assembly has not considered an override of the
318 challenged rule pursuant to this subsection, the rule shall then immediately take effect.
319 (3) Any proposed rule for which an economic impact analysis is required pursuant to
320 paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this Code section that is adopted by an agency may be
321 considered by either house of the General Assembly by the introduction of a resolution
322 for the purpose of ratifying the rule at any time within the first 30 days of the next regular

324 General Assembly, it shall be immediately transmitted to the other house of the General
325 Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding officer of the other house of the General
326 Assembly to have such house, within five days after the receipt of the resolution, to
327 consider the resolution for the purpose of ratifying the rule. In the event the resolution
328 is adopted by two-thirds of the votes of each house of the General Assembly, the rule
329 shall remain adopted and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of
330 Code Section 50-13-6. In the event the resolution is ratified by less than two-thirds of the
331 votes of either house, the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her
332 approval or veto. In the event of the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall
333 remain adopted and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of Code
334 Section 50-13-6. In the event of the Governor's veto, or if no resolution is introduced for
335 the purpose of ratifying the rule, or if the resolution introduced is not approved by at least

391 occurring in the 2028 calendar year. In establishing such schedule, the Office of Planning
392 and Budget or other designee of the Governor shall take into consideration the volume of
393 rules that will be subject to review in any given year and the ability of the public to provide
394 meaningful input into such reviews. An agency that has been through a review under this
395 Code section previously and, in the intervening years since such last review, has decreased

403 to this Code section.
404 (c) In the year of review, each agency shall undertake an analysis of each of its rules and

406 (1) Whether the benefits sought to be achieved by the rule are being realized and are in
407 compliance with current law;
408 (2) Whether such benefits justify the costs of implementing and complying with the
409 provisions of the rule;
410 (3) Whether there are less restrictive and less costly alternatives to accomplish the
411 desired benefits or results; and
412 (4) Whether the rule is mandated by federal law as a requirement for participating in or
413 implementing a federally subsidized or assisted program and whether the proposed rule

430 input shall be submitted for consideration which shall be not less than 30 days after the date
431 the notice is published. Such notice shall be published not later than March 1 of the review
432 year. In addition, the agency shall conduct at least two public hearings to receive public
433 comment on its rules. Such public hearings shall be held in a manner designed to
434 maximize public input and shall be completed not later than July 1 of the review year.
435 (e) Agencies that desire to continue their rules in effect shall not simply repromulgate the
436 rules and regulations without critical review of the necessity, effectiveness, and cost of
437 such rules; without considering possible less onerous, less costly, and more effective
438 alternatives to such rules; and without determining whether such rules or regulations are
439 actually necessary.
440 (f) Any rule that an agency desires to continue or repromulgate shall be repromulgated in
441 the same manner as for new rules under this chapter. Any continuation or repromulgation
442 of a rule shall reduce or maintain the current regulatory burden and costs of such rule and
443 shall not increase such burden or costs.
444 (g) The provisions of this Code section shall not apply to constitutional officers or their
445 respective agencies, as such terms are defined in subsection (a) of Code Section 50-13-25.
446 50-13-25.

462 the rules promulgated by such constitutional officers, their predecessors, or their respective
463 agencies that are in effect every four years, with the first year of review being the 2028
464 calendar year. In subsequent review years after 2028, each constitutional officer and such
465 officer's respective agency that has, in the intervening years since such last review,
466 decreased the number of its rules by 10 percent or more shall be exempt from review under
467 this Code section during that year of review.
468 (c) All rules of a constitutional officer and such officer's respective agency that are
469 scheduled for review under this Code section shall stand automatically repealed on
470 December 31 of the review year unless the rules are continued or repromulgated pursuant

472 (d) In the year of review, each constitutional officer and such officer's respective agencies
473 shall undertake an analysis of each of its rules and shall create a written report of the results
474 of such analysis. Such analysis shall consider:
475 (1) Whether the benefits sought to be achieved by the rule are being realized and are in
476 compliance with current law;
477 (2) Whether such benefits justify the costs of implementing and complying with the
478 provisions of the rule; and
479 (3) Whether there are less restrictive and less costly alternatives to accomplish the
480 desired benefits or results.
S. B. 28 (SUB)

25 LC 50 1234S
481 Such analysis shall be completed not later than September 1 of the year of review. Such
482 analysis shall be published by the constitutional officer on such officer's respective
483 agency's public website upon its completion and shall be forwarded to the chairpersons of
484 the House Committee on Budget and Fiscal Affairs Oversight and the Senate Committee
485 on Government Oversight.
486 (e) As a part of the rules analysis process, each constitutional officer and such officer's
487 respective agency shall solicit public input on the impact, cost, and effectiveness of its
488 rules. The public shall be notified of the opportunity to provide such input in a manner
489 designed to obtain the widest possible public notification of interested parties, as well as
490 by mailing such notice to all persons who have requested in writing that they be placed
491 upon the mailing list maintained by each constitutional officer or such officer's respective
492 agency for advance notice of its rule-making proceedings. The notice shall include a date
493 by which public input shall be submitted for consideration which shall be not less than 30
494 days after the date the notice is published. Such notice shall be published not later than
495 March 1 of the review year. In addition, each constitutional officer and such officer's
496 respective agency shall conduct at least two public hearings to receive public comment on
497 its rules. Such public hearings shall be held in a manner designed to maximize public input
498 and shall be completed not later than July 1 of the review year.
499 (f) Constitutional officers and their respective agencies that desire to continue their rules
500 in effect shall not simply repromulgate the rules and regulations without critical review of
501 the necessity, effectiveness, and cost of such rules; without considering possible less
502 onerous, less costly, and more effective alternatives to such rules; and without determining
503 whether such rules or regulations are actually necessary.
504 (g) Any rule that a constitutional officer or such officer's respective agency desires to
505 continue or repromulgate shall be repromulgated in the same manner as for new rules under
506 this chapter. Any continuation or repromulgation of a rule shall reduce or maintain the

507 current regulatory burden and costs of such rule and shall not increase such burden or costs."
508 PART III
509 SECTION 3-1.
510 Title 31 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to health, is amended in Code
511 Section 31-6-21.1, relating to procedures for rule making by the Department of Community
512 Health, by revising subsections (c) and (f) as follows:
513 "(c) Any rule or part thereof to which an objection is made by both committees within the
514 30 day objection period under subsection (b) of this Code section shall not be adopted by
515 the department and shall be invalid if so adopted. A rule or part thereof thus prohibited
516 from being adopted shall be deemed to have been withdrawn by the department unless the
517 department, within the first 15 days of the next regular session of the General Assembly,
518 transmits written notification to each member of the objecting committees that the
519 department does not intend to withdraw that rule or part thereof but intends to adopt the
520 specified rule or part effective the day following adjournment sine die of that regular
521 session. A resolution objecting to such intended adoption may be introduced in either
522 branch house of the General Assembly after the fifteenth day but before the thirtieth day
523 of the session in which occurs the notification of intent not to withdraw a rule or part
524 thereof. In the event the resolution is adopted by the branch house of the General
525 Assembly in which the resolution was introduced, it shall be immediately transmitted to
526 the other branch house of the General Assembly. It shall be the duty of the presiding
527 officer of the other branch house to have that branch house, within five days after receipt
528 of the resolution, consider the resolution for purposes of objecting to the intended adoption
529 of the rule or part thereof. Upon such resolution being adopted by two-thirds of the vote
530 of each branch house of the General Assembly, the rule or part thereof objected to in that
531 resolution shall be disapproved and not adopted by the department. If the resolution is
S. B. 28 (SUB)
- 21 -

25 LC 50 1234S
532 adopted by a majority but by less than two-thirds of the vote of each such branch house,
533 the resolution shall be submitted to the Governor for his or her approval or veto. In the
534 event of a veto, or if no resolution is introduced objecting to the rule, or if the resolution
535 introduced is not approved by at least a majority of the vote of each such branch house, the
536 rule shall automatically become adopted the day following adjournment sine die of that
537 regular session. In the event of the Governor's approval of the resolution, the rule shall be
538 disapproved and not adopted by the department."
539 "(f) Emergency rules shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (b), (c), or (d)
540 of this Code section but shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of Code
541 Section 50-13-4 and subsection (b) of Code Section 50-13-6. Upon the first expiration of
542 any department emergency rules, where those emergency rules are intended to cover
543 matters which had been dealt with by the department's nonemergency rules but such
544 nonemergency rules have been objected to by both legislative committees under this Code
545 section, the emergency rules concerning those matters may not again be adopted except for
546 one 120 day period. No emergency rule or part thereof which is adopted by the department
547 shall be valid unless adopted in compliance with this subsection."
548 SECTION 3-2.
549 Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state government, is amended
550 in Code Section 50-13A-20, relating to applicability of provisions, by revising paragraph (3)
551 of subsection (b) as follows:
552 "(3) Code Section 50-13-6, except for paragraph (2) of subsection (c) (b);"
