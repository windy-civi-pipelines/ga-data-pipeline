9 a staple part of everyday work life and a key component to the economic landscape of
10 what would become this state;
11 (2) Pineywoods cattle herds were raised by not only European settlers but also by the
12 Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, Chocktaw, and Chickasaw;
13 (3) Over time, pineywoods cattle became adapted to the Southeast, resulting in the breed
14 becoming heat tolerant, resilient, resistant to parasites and diseases, and able to be
15 productive on marginal foliage;

25 LC 62 0092
16 (4) Pineywoods cattle were extremely self sufficient, living largely independent of
17 cattlemen and being driven to a new area only by necessity;
18 (5) The breed was used for pulling timber from forests, plowing fields, and hauling
19 goods to market in addition to beef and dairy production;
20 (6) Beginning in the 1950s, larger breeds became favored for the purpose of gaining
21 weight on grain, and survival characteristics and disease resistance were bred out of the
22 larger breeds;
23 (7) Only a few families continue to keep purebred pineywoods cattle herds, creating a
24 few distinct strains. The Georgia strains include Holt, Purvis, Albany, and Popple;
25 (8) The Livestock Conservancy currently lists the breed and related strains as threatened,
26 with fewer than 1,000 annual registrations in the United States;
27 (9) Pineywoods cattle are being utilized in holistic grazing initiatives to recover native
28 species due the breed's adaptability to the climate and challenging terrain of the
29 Southeast; and
30 (10) Establishing pineywoods cattle as the official Georgia heritage cattle breed is
31 necessary to fully recognize the importance of the breed and its contributions to Georgia
32 history.
33 SECTION 2.
34 Article 3 of Chapter 3 of Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to other
35 state symbols, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
36 "50-3-94.
37 Pineywoods cattle are designated as the official Georgia heritage cattle breed."
