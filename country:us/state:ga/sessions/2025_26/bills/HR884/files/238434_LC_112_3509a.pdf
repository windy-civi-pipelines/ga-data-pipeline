15 WHEREAS, Georgia's Quick Start job training program has positioned it as a national leader
16 in workforce policies that strengthen upward mobility for impoverished families; and
17 WHEREAS, new independent research from the Sutherland Institute identifies evidence of
18 families receiving public assistance feeling disincentivized from pursuing or accepting
19 opportunities to increase their earned income and improve their financial situation; and
20 WHEREAS, this research finds that 77 percent of respondents to a statewide survey of public
21 assistance recipients report concern that earning additional income would result in a loss of
22 benefits that would worsen their family's financial situation; and
23 WHEREAS, this research further finds that 62 percent of respondents report feeling stuck
24 in a low-income job due to the belief that increased income would cause loss of benefits that
25 would not be worth the additional income; and
26 WHEREAS, this research further finds that 43 percent of respondents report having
27 intentionally limited their earned income due to fear of triggering a "benefits cliff" or
28 "benefits plateau"; and
29 WHEREAS, the Georgia Center for Opportunity has produced a computational model
30 demonstrating the effects of benefits cliffs in every Georgia county via their website,
31 benefitscliffs.org; and
32 WHEREAS, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta defines this phenomenon as a wage
33 increase that "may result in a family being financially worse off (a benefits cliff) or no better
34 off (a benefits plateau) than before the wage increase"; and

35 WHEREAS, for families who strive to improve their economic conditions, benefits cliffs,
36 benefits plateaus, and other disincentive effects have the potential to trap families in poverty
37 by hindering workforce participation and disincentivizing financial stability; and
38 WHEREAS, the State of Georgia is committed to finding innovative solutions to any
39 disincentive effects to work, family formation, economic independence, or other
40 opportunities that may be present in the social safety net; and
41 WHEREAS, due to federal restrictions, states have limited authority to experiment with
42 federally funded social safety net programs for the purpose of finding innovative reforms that
43 can address benefits cliffs, benefits plateaus, perception gaps, or other obstacles to upward
44 mobility experienced by families receiving public assistance.
45 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
46 the members of this body urge the President of the United States and Congress to grant
47 additional flexibility and autonomy to states to experiment with innovative pilot programs
48 and other reforms to improve social safety net programs by addressing any work
49 disincentives that may exist.
50 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the members of this body urge the President and
51 Congress to expedite waiver approvals for states pursuing innovative pilot programs or other
52 reforms to the social safety net.
53 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the members of this body urge the President and
54 Congress to pursue additional flexibility to the states in the form of block grants for a wider
55 array of existing social safety net programs.

62 social safety net.

64 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to
