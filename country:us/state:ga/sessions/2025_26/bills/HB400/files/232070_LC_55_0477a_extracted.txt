20 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
21 SECTION 1.
22 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Community Housing Options Increase
23 Cost Efficiency (CHOICE) Act."
24 SECTION 2.
25 The General Assembly finds and declares that:
26 (1) Georgia is facing a housing crisis caused primarily by the interaction of a housing
27 supply shortage, construction labor shortage, lasting impacts from the COVID-19
28 pandemic, outdated policies and regulations, ongoing population shifts, economic stressors,
29 and market speculation;
30 (2) Such housing crisis poses serious immediate and long-term risks to the state and its
31 residents, with significant potential repercussions in arenas such as economic development,
32 homelessness, crime, poverty, health, and education, with such repercussions likely
33 compounding over time that could have intergenerational consequences;
34 (3) According to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, the cost of new home
35 construction in Georgia has risen by 35 percent between the onset of the COVID-19
36 pandemic and the current year, while affordable rentals declined by some 67,000 units, the
37 second highest drop of any state in the United States;
38 (4) The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has assessed that
39 homelessness in Georgia has reversed its downward trend and begun increasing for the first
40 time since 2011;

25 LC 55 0477
41 (5) The National Low Income Housing Coalition has reported that housing shortages in
42 the United States have cost Americans more than 13 percent of potential GDP growth since
43 the 1960s, or nearly $9,000.00 in annual wages per worker;
44 (6) The nonprofit research group Up for Growth found that in 2023, Georgia ranked in the
45 second highest tier of states for housing underproduction, at 138,000 units below demand,
46 an increase of more than 2,600 percent over a ten-year period; and
47 (7) Therefore, this Act is needed to increase the supply of affordable housing in the state
48 by encouraging local governments to adopt policies and reforms that will promote the
49 construction of affordable housing and reduce the burden of outdated policies and
50 regulation on housing construction and the cost of housing to Georgia's citizens.
51 SECTION 3.
52 Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to conservation and natural
53 resources, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:

18 related matters; to provide a short title; to provide legislative findings; to provide an effective
19 date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.
20 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
21 SECTION 1.
22 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Community Housing Options Increase
23 Cost Efficiency (CHOICE) Act."
24 SECTION 2.
25 The General Assembly finds and declares that:
26 (1) Georgia is facing a housing crisis caused primarily by the interaction of a housing
27 supply shortage, construction labor shortage, lasting impacts from the COVID-19
28 pandemic, outdated policies and regulations, ongoing population shifts, economic stressors,
29 and market speculation;
30 (2) Such housing crisis poses serious immediate and long-term risks to the state and its
31 residents, with significant potential repercussions in arenas such as economic development,
32 homelessness, crime, poverty, health, and education, with such repercussions likely
33 compounding over time that could have intergenerational consequences;
34 (3) According to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, the cost of new home
35 construction in Georgia has risen by 35 percent between the onset of the COVID-19
36 pandemic and the current year, while affordable rentals declined by some 67,000 units, the
37 second highest drop of any state in the United States;
38 (4) The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has assessed that
39 homelessness in Georgia has reversed its downward trend and begun increasing for the first
40 time since 2011;

25 LC 55 0477
41 (5) The National Low Income Housing Coalition has reported that housing shortages in
42 the United States have cost Americans more than 13 percent of potential GDP growth since
43 the 1960s, or nearly $9,000.00 in annual wages per worker;
44 (6) The nonprofit research group Up for Growth found that in 2023, Georgia ranked in the
45 second highest tier of states for housing underproduction, at 138,000 units below demand,
46 an increase of more than 2,600 percent over a ten-year period; and
47 (7) Therefore, this Act is needed to increase the supply of affordable housing in the state
48 by encouraging local governments to adopt policies and reforms that will promote the
49 construction of affordable housing and reduce the burden of outdated policies and
50 regulation on housing construction and the cost of housing to Georgia's citizens.
51 SECTION 3.
52 Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to conservation and natural
53 resources, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:

111 Grants of such funds shall include provisions requiring adherence to adequate roadway
112 standards, accounting practices, and applicable transportation plans. Additional allocations
113 to this program from other funding sources shall be allocated subject to the requirements
114 for usage attached to such funds."
