141 fix a time and place for hearing the matter in dispute as soon as practicable; and notice

25 LC 47 3196
169 of each signature upon such form, and to the best of the circulator's knowledge, all
170 signatures upon such form are valid.
171 21-2-707.
172 (a) Within 15 days of the secretary providing the petition sponsor with official direct
173 initiative or referendum petition forms, the secretary shall mail to each household with a

176 of the full text of the proposed statutory change or constitutional amendment is available
177 for review on the secretary's website.
178 (b) Within 30 days of the petition sponsor obtaining 50 percent of the required number of
179 signatures upon a direct initiative or referendum petition, the petition sponsor shall
180 schedule public hearings on the proposed statutory change or constitutional amendment.

182 hearing shall provide at least two hours of public comment on the proposed statutory

25 LC 47 3196
193 shall complete the verification process within 30 days of receiving the signed official direct
194 initiative or referendum petition forms.
195 (c) The verification process shall be open to the public. A person observing the
196 verification process who impedes the verification process or attempts to intimidate or
197 actually intimidates any person involved in the verification process shall be guilty of a
198 felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than
199 one nor more than ten years or to pay a fine not to exceed $100,000.00, or both.
200 (d) The secretary shall use the information provided by the petitioner as well as available
201 public resources sufficient to verify the eligibility of each petitioner; provided, however,
202 that exact signature matches shall not be used in a validation process.
203 (e) Upon completing the initial verification process, the secretary shall publish his or her
204 determination as to the validity of the direct initiative or referendum petition. If the event
205 that the secretary determines that there are an insufficient number of verified petitioners
206 to validate the petition, or that petitioner information was not collected in the required
207 number of congressional districts, the petition sponsor and any petitioner whose
208 participation was determined to be invalid shall have 30 days to cure such defect. Upon
209 the close of such cure period, the secretary shall have 15 days to make a final determination
210 as to the validity of the direct initiative or referendum petition.
211 (f) If the secretary validates a direct initiative or referendum petition, the secretary shall
212 certify the total number of valid petitioners appearing on the petition, and shall put the
213 issue in question to a vote using the ballot questions outlined in the petition. The ballot
214 question shall appear on the ballot to occur on the date of the next general election at which
215 members of the General Assembly are to be elected occurring at least 90 days after the date
216 of such certification.
217 (g) The decision of the secretary to reject certification of a petition may be reviewed by
218 the Superior Court of Fulton County upon an application for a writ of mandamus to compel
219 the approval of such petition as to form. The application for such writ of mandamus shall
H. B. 702

25 LC 47 3196
220 be made within five days of the time when the petition sponsor is notified of the secretary's
221 decision. Upon the application being made, a judge of such court shall fix a time and place
222 for hearing the matter in dispute as soon as practicable, but no later than five days
223 following the receipt of such application; and notice thereof shall be served with a copy of
224 such application upon the secretary and upon the petitioner. At the time so fixed the court,
225 or any judge thereof assigned for the purpose, shall hear the case. If after such hearing the
226 said court shall find that the decision of the secretary was erroneous, it shall issue its
227 mandate to the secretary to correct his or her decision and to certify the total number of
228 valid petitioners appearing on the petition. From any decision of the superior court an
229 appeal may be taken within five days after the entry thereof.
230 21-2-709.
231 A referendum called by the secretary proposing a statutory change or constitutional
232 amendment pursuant to this article, except as provided for in this article, shall be conducted
233 in the same manner provided for in this chapter for elections to submit state-wide questions
234 to the electors.
235 21-2-710.
236 Petition sponsors shall be considered campaign committees designed to bring about the
237 approval or rejection by the voters of any proposed constitutional amendment, state-wide
238 proposed question, or state-wide referendum pursuant to Chapter 5 of this title, and shall
239 be subject to all applicable reporting and disclosure requirements provided for in that
240 chapter.

243 question proposing a statutory change or constitutional amendment.
244 21-2-712.
245 The secretary or the State Election Board may adopt rules for the proper and efficient
246 administration of procedures related to this article."
247 SECTION 2.
248 This Act shall become effective on January 1, 2027, following the ratification of an
249 amendment to the Constitution of Georgia providing for direct initiative and referendum
250 petitions to enact, repeal, or amend statutes and for direct initiative petitions of the people
251 to amend the Constitution; provided, however, that to the extent this Act conflicts with law
252 in effect at the time of ratification, this Act and such amendment shall control, and to the
253 extent such law is not in conflict, the law in effect at the time of ratification shall control and
254 shall remain in full force and effect. If such amendment is not so ratified, then this Act shall
