103 15-14-5. Such transcript shall not be created if the recorded proceeding is also taken down
104 and transcribed by a court reporter.
105 (g)(h) Where a trial is not reported or recorded as referred to in subsections (b) and (c) of
106 this Code section or where for any other reason the transcript of the proceedings is not
107 obtainable and a transcript of the evidence and proceedings is prepared from recollection,
108 the agreement of the parties thereto or their counsel, entered thereon, shall entitle such
109 transcript to be filed as a part of the record in the same manner and with the same binding
110 effect as a transcript filed by the court reporter as referred to in subsection (e) of this Code
111 section. In case of the inability of the parties to agree as to the correctness of such
112 transcript, the decision of the trial judge thereon shall be final and not subject to review;
113 and, if the trial judge is unable to recall what transpired, the judge shall enter an order
114 stating that fact.

106 this Code section or where for any other reason the transcript of the proceedings is not
107 obtainable and a transcript of the evidence and proceedings is prepared from recollection,
108 the agreement of the parties thereto or their counsel, entered thereon, shall entitle such
109 transcript to be filed as a part of the record in the same manner and with the same binding
110 effect as a transcript filed by the court reporter as referred to in subsection (e) of this Code
