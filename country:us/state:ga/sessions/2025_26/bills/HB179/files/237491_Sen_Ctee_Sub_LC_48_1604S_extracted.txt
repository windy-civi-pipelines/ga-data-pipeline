80 General, for which the court reporter shall receive compensation from the Department of
81 Law as provided by law. The original transcript shall be transmitted to the appellate court
82 as a part of the record on appeal; and one copy will be retained in the trial court, both as
83 referred to in Code Section 5-6-43. Upon filing by the court reporter, the transcript shall

85 (f) Where any party contends that the transcript or record does not truly or fully disclose
86 what transpired in the trial court and the parties are unable to agree thereon, the trial court
87 shall set the matter down for a hearing with notice to both parties and resolve the difference
88 so as to make the record conform to the truth. If anything material to either party is omitted
89 from the record on appeal or is misstated therein, the parties by stipulation, or the trial
90 court, either before or after the record is transmitted to the appellate court, on a proper
91 suggestion or of its own initiative, may direct that the omission or misstatement shall be
92 corrected and, if necessary, that a supplemental record shall be certified and transmitted by

102 taken down and transcribed by a court reporter.

104 this Code section or where for any other reason the transcript of the proceedings is not
105 obtainable and a transcript of the evidence and proceedings is prepared from recollection,
106 the agreement of the parties thereto or their counsel, entered thereon, shall entitle such
107 transcript to be filed as a part of the record in the same manner and with the same binding
108 effect as a transcript filed by the court reporter as referred to in subsection (e) of this Code
109 section. In case of the inability of the parties to agree as to the correctness of such
110 transcript, the decision of the trial judge thereon shall be final and not subject to review;

112 stating that fact.

67 matters be made and included as a part of the record. The transcript of proceedings shall

80 General, for which the court reporter shall receive compensation from the Department of
81 Law as provided by law. The original transcript shall be transmitted to the appellate court
82 as a part of the record on appeal; and one copy will be retained in the trial court, both as
83 referred to in Code Section 5-6-43. Upon filing by the court reporter, the transcript shall
84 become a part of the record in the case and need not be approved by the trial judge.

86 what transpired in the trial court and the parties are unable to agree thereon, the trial court
87 shall set the matter down for a hearing with notice to both parties and resolve the difference
88 so as to make the record conform to the truth. If anything material to either party is omitted
89 from the record on appeal or is misstated therein, the parties by stipulation, or the trial
90 court, either before or after the record is transmitted to the appellate court, on a proper
91 suggestion or of its own initiative, may direct that the omission or misstatement shall be
92 corrected and, if necessary, that a supplemental record shall be certified and transmitted by
93 the clerk of the trial court. The trial court or the appellate court may at any time order the
94 clerk of the trial court to send up any original papers or exhibits in the case, to be returned
95 after final disposition of the appeal.

107 transcript to be filed as a part of the record in the same manner and with the same binding
108 effect as a transcript filed by the court reporter as referred to in subsection (e) of this Code
