63 article that all these matters appear in the record. Where matters occur which were not
64 reported or recorded, such as objections to oral argument, misconduct of the jury, or other
65 like instances, the court, upon motion of either party, shall require that a transcript of these
66 matters be made and included as a part of the record. The transcript of proceedings shall

76 thereof with the clerk of the trial court, together with the court reporter's certificate attesting
77 to the correctness thereof. In criminal cases where the accused was convicted of a capital
78 felony, an additional copy shall be filed for the Attorney General, for which the court
79 reporter shall receive compensation from the Department of Law as provided by law. The
80 original transcript shall be transmitted to the appellate court as a part of the record on
81 appeal; and one copy will be retained in the trial court, both as referred to in Code Section
82 5-6-43. Upon filing by the reporter, the transcript shall become a part of the record in the
83 case and need not be approved by the trial judge.
84 (f) Where any party contends that the transcript or record does not truly or fully disclose
85 what transpired in the trial court and the parties are unable to agree thereon, the trial court
86 shall set the matter down for a hearing with notice to both parties and resolve the difference
87 so as to make the record conform to the truth. If anything material to either party is omitted
88 from the record on appeal or is misstated therein, the parties by stipulation, or the trial
89 court, either before or after the record is transmitted to the appellate court, on a proper
90 suggestion or of its own initiative, may direct that the omission or misstatement shall be
91 corrected and, if necessary, that a supplemental record shall be certified and transmitted by
92 the clerk of the trial court. The trial court or the appellate court may at any time order the

110 stating that fact.
111 (h)(i) Where any amendment or other pleading or paper which requires approval or
112 sanction of the court in any proceeding before being filed of record is disallowed or
113 sanction thereof is refused, the amendment, pleading, or paper may nevertheless be filed,
114 with notation of disallowance thereon, and shall become part of the record for purposes of
115 consideration on appeal or other procedure for review.

117 stipulation of the case showing how the questions arose and were decided in the trial court,
