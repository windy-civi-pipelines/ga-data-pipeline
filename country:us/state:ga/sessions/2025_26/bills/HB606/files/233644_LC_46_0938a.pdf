2 access to insurance requirements, so as to authorize the directors of the underwriting
3 association affiliated with the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan to, subject

16 (3) The FAIR Plan is backed by insurers licensed in Georgia who currently share the
17 profits, losses, and expenses of the assigned risk pool proportionally to their market share;
18 and
19 (4) Allowing risk to be spread more broadly may reduce individual insurer exposure,
20 further stabilize the FAIR Plan, and decrease the incentive for insurers to cherry-pick
21 low-risk policies.

24 insurance requirements, is amended by revising Code Section 33-33-3, relating to

31 (b) Each insurer shall participate in the writings, expenses, profits, and losses of the
32 association in the following manner:

35 (2) For commercial risks, the same proportion as its commercial premiums written bear
36 to the aggregate commercial premiums written by all insurers in the program; and
