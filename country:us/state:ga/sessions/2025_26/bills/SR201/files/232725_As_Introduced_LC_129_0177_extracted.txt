Section 1:
25 LC 129 0177
Senate Resolution 201
A RESOLUTION
1 Urging Governor Brian Kemp to include full-time care givers for the elderly, sick, and
2 disabled in the Georgia Pathways expansion; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, over 1 million Georgians are family care givers who provide regular, unpaid
4 care to parents, spouses, and others who are elderly, have a chronic health condition, and/or
5 are living with a disability; and
6 WHEREAS, the economic value of that unpaid care is estimated to be over $16 billion in
7 Georgia alone; and
8 WHEREAS, family care givers in low-income communities can help prevent or delay the
9 need for more costly Medicaid services, such as a hospital or nursing home stay, for those
10 they care for and thus provide significant support to the state's Medicaid program; and
11 WHEREAS, low-income family care givers are less likely to have access to high-quality,
12 affordable health care coverage, and about one-third report having neglected their own health
13 care due to their care giving responsibilities; and
S. R. 201

25 LC 129 0177
14 WHEREAS, adding family care giving for an adult relative as a qualifying activity under the
15 Pathways to Coverage program could increase program enrollment and help ensure
16 low-income family care givers get the health care that they need so that they can focus on
17 their care giving responsibilities, which decrease the burden of more high-need and costly
18 Medicaid enrollees on the state budget.
19 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
20 urge Governor Brian Kemp to include full-time care givers for the elderly, sick, and disabled
21 in the Georgia Pathways expansion.
22 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
23 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and the
24 press.
