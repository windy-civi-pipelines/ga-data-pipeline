355 (a) The authority, or any entity or body which has or which may in the future succeed to
356 the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority created hereby, shall have power
357 and is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue bonds by the
358 authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the costs of the project and for the
359 purpose of refunding revenue bonds or other obligations previously issued. The principal
360 of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund hereby
361 provided for such payment. The revenue bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear
362 interest at such rate or rates per annum, payable at such time or times, shall mature at such
363 time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such
364 medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority,
365 and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or
366 prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the
367 resolution for the issuance of such revenue bonds.
368 (b) The authority shall determine the form of the revenue bonds and shall fix the
369 denomination or denominations of such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds may be issued
370 in registered form, and provision may be made for registration and exchangeability
371 privileges. The authority shall fix the place or places of payment of principal and interest
372 thereon.
373 (c) All revenue bonds shall bear the manual or facsimile signature of the chairperson or
374 vice-chairperson of the authority and the attesting manual or facsimile signature of the
375 secretary-treasurer of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be impressed
376 or imprinted thereon. Any revenue bonds may bear the manual or facsimile signature of
377 such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such revenue bonds shall be duly
378 authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of issuance of such revenue bonds
H. B. 548
- 15 -
25 LC 47 3233
379 such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. In case
380 any officer whose signature shall appear on any revenue bond shall cease to be such officer
381 before the delivery of such revenue bond, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and
382 sufficient for all purposes, the same as if that person had remained in office until such
383 delivery.
384 (d) All revenue bonds shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and
385 incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of the state. All revenue bonds, their
386 transfer, and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within the state.
387 (e) To the maximum extent as permitted by general law, the authority shall be exempt
388 from taxation.
389 (f) The authority may sell revenue bonds in such manner and for such price as it may
390 determine to be in the best interest of the authority. The proceeds derived from the sale of
391 revenue bonds shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes provided in the resolutions
392 and proceedings authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds.
393 (g) Prior to the preparation of any definitive revenue bonds, the authority may, under like
394 restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary revenue bonds,
395 exchangeable for definitive revenue bonds upon the issuance of the latter.
396 (h) The authority may provide for the replacement of any revenue bonds which shall
397 become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.
398 (i) The authority shall adopt a resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds.
399 Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act
400 shall become effective immediately upon its passage. Any such resolution may be passed
401 by a majority of the authority's members at any regular or special meeting.
402 (j) Revenue bonds shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the city or county nor a
403 pledge of the faith and credit of the city or county, but such revenue bonds shall be payable
404 solely from the fund hereinafter provided for. The issuance of such revenue bonds shall
405 not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the city or county to levy or to pledge any
H. B. 548
- 16 -
25 LC 47 3233
406 form of taxation whatsoever for payment of such revenue bonds or to make any
407 appropriation for their payment, and all such revenue bonds shall contain recitals on their
408 face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. Notwithstanding the
409 foregoing provisions, this Act shall not affect the ability of the authority and any political
410 subdivision, municipal corporation, or other public body, including, without limitation, the
411 county and the city, to enter into an intergovernmental contract pursuant to which the
412 political subdivision, municipal corporation, or other public body agrees to pay amounts
413 sufficient to pay operating charges and other costs of the authority or any project including,
414 without limitation, the principal of and interest on revenue bonds in consideration for
415 services or facilities of the authority.
416 (k) In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of revenue bonds may be secured by a
417 trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any
418 trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the state.
419 Either the resolution providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds or such trust indenture
420 may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the
421 bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including
422 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition and
423 construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project,
424 and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all monies.
425 (l) In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture,
426 the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue bonds
427 to any officer or person, or any agency, bank, or trust company, who shall act as trustee of
428 such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such
429 regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.
430 (m) The moneys received pursuant to an intergovernmental contract and the revenues,
431 fees, tolls, charges, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless
432 of whether or not such revenues, fees, tolls, fines, charges, and earnings were produced by
H. B. 548
- 17 -
25 LC 47 3233
433 a particular project for which revenue bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged
434 and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the
435 principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the
436 issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture may provide, and such funds so
437 pledged from whatever source received shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be
438 provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund
439 shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of the interest upon such revenue bonds
440 as such interest shall fall due; the principal or purchase price of such revenue bonds as the
441 same shall fall due; any premium upon such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due; the
442 purchase of such revenue bonds in the open market; and the necessary charges of the
443 paying agent for paying principal and interest. The use and disposition of such sinking
444 fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing
445 the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise
446 be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as
447 a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one
448 over another.
449 (n) Any holder of revenue bonds and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except
450 to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the
451 issuance of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by
452 suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under
453 the laws of the state, including specifically but without limitation the 'Revenue Bond Law,'
454 or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and
455 compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust
456 indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing,
457 charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the
458 facilities and services furnished.

459 (o) Revenue bonds and the security therefor shall be confirmed and validated in
460 accordance with the 'Revenue Bond Law.' The petition for validation shall also make the
461 party defendant to such action any city, municipal corporation, school district, or other
462 political subdivision or authority of the state, or other public body, which has contracted
463 with the authority for services or facilities relating to the project for which revenue bonds
464 are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such defendant shall be required to show
465 cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts shall not be adjudicated as a part of the
466 basis for the security for the payment of any such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds when
467 validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such
468 revenue bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon, and against
469 the defendants in such action, and as to all other questions which could and should have
470 been asserted during the bond validation proceedings.
471 (p) Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit
472 or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Dougherty
473 County, and any action pertaining to validation of any revenue bonds issued under the
474 provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive,
475 original jurisdiction of such actions.
476 (q) While any of the revenue bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the
477 powers, duties, or existence of said authority or its officers, employees, or agents, shall not
478 be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights
479 of the holders of such revenue bonds. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit
480 of the authority and the holders of any such revenue bonds.
481 (r) All monies received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the
482 sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenue, income, fees, and
483 earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this
484 Act.

488 revenue bonds or other types of obligations as herein provided to finance, in whole or in
489 part, the costs of the project, and to pledge to the punctual payment of said revenue bonds

500 deposited with and shall be received by all public officers and bodies of this state and all
501 political subdivisions for any purpose for which the deposit of the bonds or other
502 obligations of this state is now or may hereafter be authorized.
503 (u) The offer, sale, or issuance of bonds or other obligations of the authority shall be
504 exempt from registration to the extent provided in the Georgia Uniform Securities Act
505 of 2008, as the same may be amended from time to time, or in any other law.
506 (v) While any revenue bonds issued by the authority prior to the effective date of this Act
507 remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority or its officers,
508 employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired by this Act in any manner that
509 will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such revenue bonds. This
510 subsection shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such revenue
511 bonds.

354 Revenue bonds.
355 (a) The authority, or any entity or body which has or which may in the future succeed to
356 the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority created hereby, shall have power
357 and is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue bonds by the
358 authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the costs of the project and for the
359 purpose of refunding revenue bonds or other obligations previously issued. The principal
360 of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund hereby
361 provided for such payment. The revenue bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear
362 interest at such rate or rates per annum, payable at such time or times, shall mature at such
363 time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such
364 medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority,
365 and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or
366 prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the
367 resolution for the issuance of such revenue bonds.
368 (b) The authority shall determine the form of the revenue bonds and shall fix the
369 denomination or denominations of such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds may be issued
370 in registered form, and provision may be made for registration and exchangeability
371 privileges. The authority shall fix the place or places of payment of principal and interest
372 thereon.
373 (c) All revenue bonds shall bear the manual or facsimile signature of the chairperson or
374 vice-chairperson of the authority and the attesting manual or facsimile signature of the
375 secretary-treasurer of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be impressed
376 or imprinted thereon. Any revenue bonds may bear the manual or facsimile signature of
377 such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such revenue bonds shall be duly
378 authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of issuance of such revenue bonds
H. B. 548
- 15 -

25 LC 47 3233
379 such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. In case
380 any officer whose signature shall appear on any revenue bond shall cease to be such officer
381 before the delivery of such revenue bond, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and
382 sufficient for all purposes, the same as if that person had remained in office until such
383 delivery.
384 (d) All revenue bonds shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and
385 incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of the state. All revenue bonds, their
386 transfer, and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within the state.

388 from taxation.
389 (f) The authority may sell revenue bonds in such manner and for such price as it may

391 revenue bonds shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes provided in the resolutions
392 and proceedings authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds.
393 (g) Prior to the preparation of any definitive revenue bonds, the authority may, under like
394 restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary revenue bonds,
395 exchangeable for definitive revenue bonds upon the issuance of the latter.
396 (h) The authority may provide for the replacement of any revenue bonds which shall
397 become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.
398 (i) The authority shall adopt a resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds.
399 Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act
400 shall become effective immediately upon its passage. Any such resolution may be passed
401 by a majority of the authority's members at any regular or special meeting.
402 (j) Revenue bonds shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the city or county nor a
403 pledge of the faith and credit of the city or county, but such revenue bonds shall be payable
404 solely from the fund hereinafter provided for. The issuance of such revenue bonds shall
405 not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the city or county to levy or to pledge any
H. B. 548
- 16 -

25 LC 47 3233
406 form of taxation whatsoever for payment of such revenue bonds or to make any
407 appropriation for their payment, and all such revenue bonds shall contain recitals on their
408 face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. Notwithstanding the
409 foregoing provisions, this Act shall not affect the ability of the authority and any political
410 subdivision, municipal corporation, or other public body, including, without limitation, the
411 county and the city, to enter into an intergovernmental contract pursuant to which the
412 political subdivision, municipal corporation, or other public body agrees to pay amounts
413 sufficient to pay operating charges and other costs of the authority or any project including,
414 without limitation, the principal of and interest on revenue bonds in consideration for
415 services or facilities of the authority.
416 (k) In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of revenue bonds may be secured by a
417 trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any
418 trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the state.
419 Either the resolution providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds or such trust indenture
420 may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the
421 bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including
422 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition and
423 construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project,
424 and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all monies.
425 (l) In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture,
426 the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue bonds
427 to any officer or person, or any agency, bank, or trust company, who shall act as trustee of
428 such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such
429 regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.
430 (m) The moneys received pursuant to an intergovernmental contract and the revenues,
431 fees, tolls, charges, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless
432 of whether or not such revenues, fees, tolls, fines, charges, and earnings were produced by
H. B. 548
- 17 -

25 LC 47 3233
433 a particular project for which revenue bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged
434 and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the
435 principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the
436 issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture may provide, and such funds so
437 pledged from whatever source received shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be
438 provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund
439 shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of the interest upon such revenue bonds
440 as such interest shall fall due; the principal or purchase price of such revenue bonds as the
441 same shall fall due; any premium upon such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due; the
442 purchase of such revenue bonds in the open market; and the necessary charges of the
443 paying agent for paying principal and interest. The use and disposition of such sinking
444 fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing
445 the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise
446 be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as
447 a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one
448 over another.
449 (n) Any holder of revenue bonds and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except
450 to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the
451 issuance of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by
452 suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under
453 the laws of the state, including specifically but without limitation the 'Revenue Bond Law,'
454 or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and
455 compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust
456 indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing,
457 charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the
458 facilities and services furnished.

459 (o) Revenue bonds and the security therefor shall be confirmed and validated in
460 accordance with the 'Revenue Bond Law.' The petition for validation shall also make the
461 party defendant to such action any city, municipal corporation, school district, or other
462 political subdivision or authority of the state, or other public body, which has contracted
463 with the authority for services or facilities relating to the project for which revenue bonds
464 are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such defendant shall be required to show
465 cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts shall not be adjudicated as a part of the
466 basis for the security for the payment of any such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds when
467 validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such
468 revenue bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon, and against
469 the defendants in such action, and as to all other questions which could and should have
470 been asserted during the bond validation proceedings.
