A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the House Study Committee on Pharmacy Benefits Managers and Consumer Access
2 to Prescription Medications; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, according to the United States Office of Health Policy, the cost of prescription
4 drugs has increased at rates exceeding the rate of inflation each year since 2016; and
5 WHEREAS, pharmacy benefits managers administer prescription drug insurance benefits,
6 negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies, and establish drug formularies and
7 pharmacy networks; and
8 WHEREAS, pharmacy benefits managers undertake practices that have been criticized and
9 investigated by industry stakeholders, including health policy experts, state attorneys general,
10 and the Federal Trade Commission; and
11 WHEREAS, such policies include leveraging vertical integration to steer patients to
12 pharmacy benefits manager affiliate pharmacies, marking up the cost of medications at
13 pharmacy benefits manager owned pharmacies, manipulating pharmacy reimbursement rates,
14 and engaging in other unfair practices that harm patients, retail pharmacies, payers, and
15 employers; and

16 WHEREAS, in 2019, Georgia passed the first pharmacy benefits manager steering laws in
17 the nation but many believe that pharmacy benefits managers continue to steer patients to
18 pharmacy benefits manager affiliate pharmacies within this state; and
19 WHEREAS, Georgia law requires that pharmacy benefits managers publicly report drug
20 prices that are greater than 10 percent over the national average drug acquisition costs and
21 such reports have revealed markups for some medications for commercial and government
22 payers and markups of thousands of percent above the national average drug acquisition
23 costs for medications used to treat multiple sclerosis, cancer, and kidney disease, among
24 other medications; and
25 WHEREAS, a recent study by the Georgia Center for Rural Prosperity and Innovation at
26 Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College indicates that pharmacy benefits manager practices
27 pose risks to patients and independent pharmacies, including increasing the number of
28 counties in Georgia without a single pharmacy.

30 (1) Creation of House study committee. There is created the House Study Committee
31 on Pharmacy Benefits Managers and Consumer Access to Prescription Medications.
