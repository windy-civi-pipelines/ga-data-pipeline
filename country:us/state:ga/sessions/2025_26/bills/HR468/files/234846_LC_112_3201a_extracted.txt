Section 1:
25 LC 112 3201
House Resolution 468
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing the historical significance of the 1911 Rand McNally map of White County,
2 Georgia; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the 1911 Rand McNally map of White County, Georgia, provides a valuable
4 historical snapshot of the region's geography, infrastructure, and cultural landmarks as they
5 existed in the early 20th century; and
6 WHEREAS, the map highlights several communities that were once integral to the county's
7 social and economic fabric but have since diminished or disappeared, including Kinsey, Leo,
8 Loudsville, Nacoochee, Oculus, Parks, Pink, Asbestos, Benefit, Church, Cleveland, Eastburn,
9 Etris, Headen, Teshatee, Santee, Robertstown, Pole, and Pleasant Retreat, each of which
10 played a significant role in the area's development yet, over time, has been lost or absorbed
11 into larger towns or counties; and
12 WHEREAS, Kinsey, once a thriving community, was home to a strong agricultural base and
13 many pioneering families who helped shape the area's early economy—though no longer a
14 recognized town, its legacy remains in the memories of local families; and

15 WHEREAS, Leo, located near the Chattahoochee River, was a vital stop for travelers and
16 traders in the early days, facilitating commerce and communication through its strategic
17 position—while the river once supported a bustling community, it now reflects a quieter,
18 more rural landscape; and
19 WHEREAS, Loudsville, a community that emerged during the gold rush era, was home to
20 miners and traders seeking to capitalize on rich gold veins—though the town has faded into
21 history, its spirit can still be felt in the nearby mining towns that celebrate their shared
22 heritage; and
23 WHEREAS, Nacoochee, nestled in the Nacoochee Valley, remains a cultural touchstone
24 where Native American history meets early settler expansion, and while the town has largely
25 disappeared, the nearby Nacoochee Mound stands as a testament to its past; and
26 WHEREAS, Oculus, an early rural settlement, was known for its picturesque views and
27 close-knit community—although no physical remnants remain today, the legacy of its
28 residents continues to resonate throughout the surrounding area; and
29 WHEREAS, Parks, Pink, and Asbestos, smaller communities that developed during the early
30 industrial age, thrived for a time with local factories and mills but eventually dwindled and
31 disappeared; and
32 WHEREAS, Benefit, Church, and Cleveland were early religious and civic centers for the
33 region, serving as gathering spots for local residents to connect socially and spiritually, and
34 while these communities have undergone significant transformation, their role in shaping the
35 county's social fabric remains undeniable; and

36 WHEREAS, Eastburn, Etris, Headen, and Teshatee were vital to the development of the
37 agricultural economy in the region, providing farmlands and settlements that contributed to
38 White County's rural identity, yet they no longer exist as recognized towns; and
39 WHEREAS, Santee, Robertstown, Pole, and Pleasant Retreat, though long since forgotten
40 or absorbed by other municipalities, were once key crossroads for commerce and travel,
41 providing services and support to travelers and locals alike; and
42 WHEREAS, the map illustrates the layout of early transportation networks, including historic
43 roadways, railways, and settlements that shaped the development of small towns and rural
44 communities within White County; and
45 WHEREAS, many of the communities, settlements, and named locations on the map reflect
46 a way of life that has since evolved due to industrialization, urbanization, and shifts in
47 economic and social structures; and
48 WHEREAS, preserving and recognizing this historical cartographic record allows for a
49 deeper appreciation of the county's heritage and provides insight into how the landscape and
50 society have changed over time; and
51 WHEREAS, the study and commemoration of these lost or transformed landmarks contribute
52 to the broader understanding of Georgia's small-town history and the forces that shaped its
53 development throughout the 20th century.
54 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
55 the members of this body recognize the historical significance of the 1911 Rand McNally

25 LC 112 3201
56 map of White County, Georgia, and encourage further efforts to document, study, and
57 educate the public about the county's evolving geography and cultural legacy.

59 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
60 public and the press.
