25 LC 62 0194S
17 hereinafter called Occupant, whose last known address is _________________. For the
18 consideration hereinafter stated, Owner agrees to let Occupant use and occupy a space

20 of __________, County of ________, State of Georgia, and more particularly described

29 a like amount for each month thereafter, until the termination of this agreement.
30 If any monthly installment is not paid by the seventh calendar day of the month due, or

33 Occupant further agrees to pay the sum of one month's fees, which shall be used as a
34 clean-up and maintenance fund, and is to be used, if required, for the repair of any
35 damage done to the space and to clean up the space at the termination of the agreement.
36 In the event that the space is left in a good state of repair, and in a broom-swept
37 condition, then this amount shall be refunded to Occupant. However, it is agreed to
38 between the parties that Owner may set off any claims it may have against Occupant from
39 this fund.
40 The space named herein is to be used by Occupant solely for the purpose of storing any
41 personal property belonging to Occupant. Occupant agrees not to store any explosives
42 or any highly inflammable goods or any other goods in the space which would cause

59 SEVENTH CALENDAR DAY OF THE MONTH DUE, OR IF ANY CHECK
60 GIVEN IN PAYMENT IS DISHONORED BY THE FINANCIAL
61 INSTITUTION ON WHICH IT IS DRAWN, OCCUPANT IS IN DEFAULT
62 FROM DATE PAYMENT WAS DUE.
63 I hereby agree that all notices other than bills and invoices shall be given by hand
64 delivery, verified mail, or email at the following addresses:
65 ___________________________________________________________ (hand delivery)
66 ____________________________________________________________ (verified mail)
67 ___________________________________________________________ (email).
68 and I further understand that I may designate to owner Owner an agent to receive such
69 notice by providing:
70 ___________________________________________________________ (hand delivery)
- 3 -
25 LC 62 0194S
71 ____________________________________________________________ (verified mail)
72 ___________________________________________________________ (email).
73 For purposes of Owner's lien: '"personal property '" means movable property, not affixed
74 to land, and includes, but is not limited to, goods, wares, merchandise, motor vehicles,
75 trailers, watercraft, household items, and furnishings; '"last known address '" means the
76 street address or post office box address provided by Occupant in the latest rental
77 agreement or the address provided by Occupant in a subsequent written notice of a
78 change of address by hand delivery, verified mail, or email.
79 Owner's lien is superior to any other lien or security interest, except those which are
80 evidenced by a certificate of title or perfected and recorded prior to the date of this rental
81 agreement in Georgia, in the name of Occupant, either in the county of Occupant's 'last
82 known address' or in the county where the self-service storage facility is located, except
83 any tax lien as provided by law and except those liens or security interests of whom
84 Owner has knowledge through Occupant's disclosure in this rental agreement or through
85 other written notice. Occupant attests that the personal property in Occupant's space(s)
86 is free and clear of all liens and secured interests except for ____________. Owner's lien
87 attaches as of the date the personal property is brought to the self-service storage facility.
88 Except as otherwise specifically provided in this rental agreement, the exclusive care,
89 custody, and control of any and all personal property stored in the leased space shall
90 remain vested in Occupant. Owner does not become a bailee of Occupant's personal
91 property by the enforcement of Owner's lien.
92 If Occupant has been in default continuously for thirty (30) days, Owner may enforce its
93 lien, provided Owner shall comply with the following procedure:
94 Occupant shall be notified of Owner's intent to enforce Owner's lien by written notice
95 delivered in person, by verified mail, or by email. Owner also shall notify other parties
96 with superior liens or security interests as defined in this rental agreement. A notice
97 given pursuant to this rental agreement shall be presumed sent when it is deposited with
- 4 -
25 LC 62 0194S
98 the United States Postal Service or the statutory overnight delivery service properly
99 addressed with postage or delivery fees prepaid or sent by email. If Owner sends notice
100 of a pending sale of property to Occupant's last known email address and does not
101 receive a nonautomated response or a receipt of delivery to the email address, Owner
102 shall send notice of the sale to Occupant by verified mail to Occupant's last known
103 address or to the last known address of the designated agent of the Occupant before
104 proceeding with the sale.
105 Owner's notice to Occupant shall include an itemized statement of Owner's claim
106 showing the sum due at the time of the notice and the date when the sum became due.
107 Owner's notice shall notify Occupant of denial of access to the personal property and
108 provide the name, street address, email address, and telephone number of Owner or its
109 designated agent, whom Occupant may contact to respond to this notice. Owner's
110 notice shall demand payment within a specified time, not less than fourteen (14) days
111 after delivery of the notice. It shall state that, unless the claim is paid, within the time
112 stated in the notice, the personal property will be advertised for public sale to the
113 highest bidder, and will be sold at a public sale to the highest bidder, at a specified time
114 and place.
115 After the expiration of the time given in Owner's notice, Owner shall publish an
116 advertisement of the public sale to the highest bidder, once a week, for two consecutive
117 weeks, in the legal organ for the county where the self-service storage facility is located;
118 provided, however, that the advertisement of the sale may be done in any other
119 commercially reasonable manner when the property being sold is anything other than a
120 motor vehicle, motorcycle, trailer, any watercraft, or any recreational vehicle. The
121 advertisement and sale shall be deemed commercially reasonable if at least three (3)
122 independent bidders attend the sale at the time and place advertised. '"Independent bidder
123 '" means a bidder who is not related to and who has no controlling interest in, or common
124 pecuniary interest with, Owner or any other bidder. The advertisement shall include: a
- 5 -
25 LC 62 0194S
125 brief and general description of the personal property, reasonably adequate to permit its
126 identification; the address of the self-service storage facility, and the number, if any, of
127 the space where the personal property is located, and the name of Occupant; and the time,
128 place, and manner of the public sale. The public sale to the highest bidder shall take
129 place not sooner than fifteen (15) days after the first publication. Regardless of whether
130 a sale involves the property of more than one Occupant, a single advertisement may be
131 used to advertise the disposal of property at the sale. A public sale includes offering the
132 property on a publicly accessible website that regularly conducts online auctions of
133 personal property. Such sale shall be considered incidental to the self-storage business
134 and no license shall be required.
135 If no one purchases the property at the public sale and if Owner has complied with the
136 foregoing procedures, Owner may otherwise dispose of the property and shall notify
137 Occupant of the action taken. Any sale or disposition of the personal property shall be
138 held at the self-service storage facility or at the nearest suitable place to where the
139 personal property is held or stored.
140 Before any sale or other disposition of personal property pursuant to this agreement,
141 Occupant may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses
142 incurred and thereby redeem the personal property and thereafter Owner shall have no
143 liability to any person with respect to such personal property.
144 A Purchaser in good faith of the personal property sold to satisfy Owner's lien takes the
145 property free of any rights of persons against whom the lien was valid, despite
146 noncompliance by Owner with the requirements of this agreement.
147 In the event of a sale, Owner may satisfy his or her lien from the proceeds of the sale.
148 Owner shall hold the balance of the proceeds, if any, for Occupant or any notified secured
149 interest holder. If not claimed within two years of the date of sale, the balance of the
150 proceeds shall be disposed of in accordance with Article 5 of Chapter 12 of Title 44, the
- 6 -
25 LC 62 0194S
151 '"Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act.'" In no event shall Owner's liability exceed the
152 proceeds of the sale.
153 If the rental agreement contains a limit on the value of property stored in Occupant's
154 storage space, the limit shall be deemed to be the maximum value of the property stored
155 in that space.
156 If the property upon which the lien is claimed is a motor vehicle, trailer, or watercraft and
157 rent and other charges related to the property remain unpaid or unsatisfied for 60 days
158 following the maturity of the obligation to pay rent, Owner may have the property towed
159 in lieu of foreclosing on the lien. If a motor vehicle, trailer, or watercraft is towed as
160 authorized in this section, Owner shall not be liable for the motor vehicle, trailer, or
161 watercraft or any damages to the motor vehicle, trailer, or watercraft once the tower takes
162 possession of the property.'"
163 SECTION 2.
164 The Act shall become effective on July 1, 2025, and shall apply to any actions for lien
165 enforcement without judicial intervention initiated on or after such date.
166 SECTION 3.
167 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
