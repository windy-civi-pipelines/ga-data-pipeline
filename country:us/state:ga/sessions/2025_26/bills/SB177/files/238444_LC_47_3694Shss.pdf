25 LC 47 3694S
13 "ARTICLE 5
14 21-5-90.
15 The General Assembly finds:
16 (1) That the voters, citizens, and policymakers of Georgia are entitled to transparency in
17 the political and propaganda activities of organizations that may be controlled by or under
18 the influence of foreign countries hostile to the interests of the United States and the State
19 of Georgia;
20 (2) That, in an increasingly globalized world, determining whether an organization's
21 political and propaganda activities are funded by hostile foreign interests is often
22 difficult; and
23 (3) That legislation is needed to ensure the transparency necessary to allow voters,
24 citizens, and policymakers to evaluate whether political and propaganda activities are
25 funded by potentially hostile foreign actors.
