10 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
11 SECTION 1.

14 ideology that has, among other things, resulted in a massive unexplained rise in diagnoses
15 of gender dysphoria;

25 LC 46 1061S (SCS)
16 (2) Senate Bill 140 enacted by the General Assembly in the 2023 regular session broadly
17 banned physicians from performing sex reassignment surgeries, hormone replacement
18 therapies, and other gender transition procedures on minors, and similar bills from other
19 states have been upheld by a federal appeals court;
20 (3) In October, 2023, under the guidance of the Georgia Attorney General, a lawsuit
21 brought by or on behalf of a number of state employees and a child seeking access to
22 transgender related healthcare coverage under the state health plan was settled;
23 (4) Prior to the settlement, coverage under the state health benefit plan excluded
24 operations to change one's sex and related services;
25 (5) Under the settlement, the state health benefit plan was required to implement
26 provisions defining transgender related health coverage and to make it available to all
27 employees. In addition, the state reportedly paid a sum of $365,000.00 that was split
28 among four individuals, including a child, and an organization called the Campaign for
29 Southern Equality, which has been described in news reports as "a nonprofit organization
30 dedicated to advancing LGBTQ+ civil rights in the South." According to the plaintiffs'
31 attorneys, the settlement also covered a portion of the plaintiffs' legal expenses;
32 (6) This settlement was entered into by the state health benefit plan and the Attorney
33 General without prior notice to or approval by the General Assembly; and
34 (7) It is the policy of the State of Georgia that these procedures shall neither be covered
35 by the state health benefit plan nor otherwise paid for through the use of state funds.
36 SECTION 2.
37 Chapter 18 of Title 45 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to employees'
38 insurance and benefits plans, is amended by revising Code Section 45-18-4, relating to

54 birth, including secondary sex characteristics, without regard to an individual's
55 psychological, chosen, or subjective identification of gender.
56 (6) 'Sex reassignment surgery' means any surgical procedure that seeks to surgically alter
57 or remove healthy or nondiseased physical or anatomical characteristics or features that
58 are typical for an individual's sex in order to instill or create physiological or anatomical
59 characteristics that resemble a sex different from such individual's sex. Such term means
60 genital or nongenital surgery performed for the purpose of assisting an individual with
61 attempting to alter such individual's sex or to alter the appearance of or affirm such
