12 (1) The State of Georgia has taken measures to protect individuals from a radical gender
13 ideology that has, among other things, resulted in a massive unexplained rise in diagnoses

17 therapies, and other gender transition procedures on minors, and similar bills from other
18 states have been upheld by a federal appeals court;
19 (3) In October, 2023, under the guidance of the Georgia Attorney General, a lawsuit
20 brought by or on behalf of a number of state employees and a child seeking access to
21 transgender related healthcare coverage under the state health plan was settled;
22 (4) Prior to the settlement, coverage under the state health benefit plan excluded
23 operations to change one's sex and related services;
24 (5) Under the settlement, the state health benefit plan was required to implement
25 provisions defining transgender related health coverage and to make it available to all
26 employees. In addition, the state reportedly paid a sum of $365,000.00 that was split
27 among four individuals, including a child, and an organization called the Campaign for
28 Southern Equality, which has been described in news reports as "a nonprofit organization
29 dedicated to advancing LGBTQ+ civil rights in the South." According to the plaintiffs'
30 attorneys, the settlement also covered a portion of the plaintiffs' legal expenses;
31 (6) This settlement was entered into by the state health benefit plan and the Attorney
32 General without prior notice to or approval by the General Assembly; and
33 (7) It is the policy of the State of Georgia that these procedures shall neither be covered
34 by the state health benefit plan nor otherwise paid for through the use of state funds.
35 SECTION 2.
36 Chapter 18 of Title 45 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to employees'

43 male or female.

46 sex that is inconsistent with such individual's sex.

54 psychological, chosen, or subjective identification of gender.
55 (6) 'Sex reassignment surgery' means any surgical procedure that seeks to surgically alter
56 or remove healthy or nondiseased physical or anatomical characteristics or features that
57 are typical for an individual's sex in order to instill or create physiological or anatomical
58 characteristics that resemble a sex different from such individual's sex. Such term means
59 genital or nongenital surgery performed for the purpose of assisting an individual with
60 attempting to alter such individual's sex or to alter the appearance of or affirm such
61 individual's perception of his or her gender or sex if such appearance or perception is
