190 (a) Every insurer shall maintain with the Commissioner copies of the rates, rating plans,
191 rating systems, underwriting rules, and policy or bond forms used by it. The maintenance
192 of rates, rating plans, rating systems, underwriting rules, and policy or bond forms with the
193 Commissioner by a licensed rating organization of which an insurer is a member or
194 subscriber will be sufficient compliance with this Code section for any insurer maintaining
195 membership or subscriberships in such organization, to the extent that the insurer uses the
H. B. 733
- 8 -

25 LC 52 0818
196 rates, rating plans, rating systems, underwriting rules, and policy or bond forms of such
197 organization; provided, however, that the Commissioner, when he or she deems it
198 necessary, without compliance with the rule-making procedures of this title or Chapter 13
199 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act':
200 (1) May require any domestic, foreign, and alien insurer to file the required rates, rating
201 plans, rating systems, underwriting rules, and policy or bond forms used independent of
202 any filing made on its behalf or as a member of a licensed rating organization, as the
203 Commissioner shall deem to be necessary to ensure compliance with the standards of this
204 chapter and Code Section 34-9-130 and for the best interests of the citizens of this state;
205 (2) Shall require each domestic, foreign, and alien insurer, writing or authorized to write
206 workers' compensation insurance in this state, to file such insurer's own individual rate
207 filing for rates to be charged for workers' compensation insurance coverage written in this
208 state. Such rates shall be developed and established after consultation with the State
209 Board of Workers' Compensation based upon each individual insurer's experience in the
210 State of Georgia to the extent actuarially credible. The experience filed shall include the
211 loss ratios, reserves, reserve development information, expenses, including commissions
212 paid and dividends paid, investment income, pure premium data adjusted for loss
213 development and loss trending, profits, and all other data and information used by that
214 insurer in formulating its workers' compensation rates which are used in this state and any
215 other information or data required by the Commissioner. In establishing and maintaining
216 loss reserves, no workers' compensation insurer shall be allowed to maintain any excess
217 loss reserve for any claim or potential claim for more than 90 days after the amount of
218 liability for such claim or potential claim has been established, whether by final
219 judgment, by settlement agreement, or otherwise. This limitation on the maintenance of
220 loss reserves shall be enforced through this Code section, as well as through Code
221 Section 33-9-23, relating to examination of admitted insurers, and any other appropriate
222 enforcement procedures. The Commissioner is authorized to accept such rate
H. B. 733
- 9 -

25 LC 52 0818
223 classifications as are reasonable and necessary for compliance with this chapter. A rate
224 filing required by this paragraph shall be updated by the insurer at least once every two
225 years; and
226 (3) As used in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the term 'excess loss reserve' means any
227 reserve amount in excess of the reserve required by law.
228 (b) Any domestic, foreign, or alien insurer that is authorized to write insurance in this state
229 must shall file with the Commissioner any rate, rating plan, rating system, or underwriting
230 rule for all personal private passenger motor vehicle insurance:
231 (1) For private passenger motor vehicle insurance providing only the mandatory
232 minimum limits required by Code Section 33-34-4 and subsection (a) of Code
233 Section 40-9-37, and no such rate, rating plan, rating system, or underwriting rule shall
234 become effective, nor may any premium be collected by any insurer thereunder, unless
235 the filing has been received by the Commissioner in his or her office and such filing has
236 been approved by the Commissioner or a period of 45 60 days has elapsed from the date
237 such filing was received by the Commissioner during which time such filing has not been
238 disapproved by the Commissioner. The Commissioner shall be authorized to extend such
239 45 60 day period by no more than 55 40 days at his or her discretion. If a filing is
240 disapproved, notice of such disapproval order shall be given within 100 days of receipt
241 of filing by the Commissioner, specifying in what respects such filing fails to meet the
242 requirements of this chapter. The filer shall be given a hearing upon written request made
243 within 30 days after the issuance of the disapproval order, and such hearing shall
244 commence within 30 days after such request unless postponed by mutual consent. Such
245 hearing, once commenced, may be postponed or recessed by the Commissioner only for
246 weekends, holidays, or after normal working hours or at any time by mutual consent of
247 all parties to the hearing. The Commissioner may also, at his or her discretion, recess any
248 hearing for not more than two recess periods of up to 15 consecutive days each. In
249 connection with any hearing or judicial review with respect to the approval or disapproval
H. B. 733
- 10 -

25 LC 52 0818
250 of such rates, the burden of persuasion shall fall upon the affected insurer or insurers to
251 establish that the challenged rates are adequate, not excessive, and not unfairly
252 discriminatory, and not unjustifiably increased. After such a hearing, the Commissioner
253 must shall affirm, modify, or reverse his or her previous action within the time period
254 provided in subsection (a) of Code Section 33-2-23 relative to orders of the
255 Commissioner. The requirement of approval or disapproval of a rate filing by the
256 Commissioner under this subsection shall not prohibit actions by the Commissioner
257 regarding compliance of such rate filing with the requirements of Code Section 33-9-4
258 brought after such approval or disapproval.
259 (2) For personal private passenger motor vehicle insurance other than that described in
260 paragraph (1) of this subsection, such rate, rating plan, rating system, or underwriting rule
261 for all such personal private passenger motor vehicle insurance shall be effective 60 days
262 after such filing and shall be implemented without approval of the Commissioner, unless
263 an earlier effective date is authorized by the Commissioner or a later effective date is
264 specified by the insurer. This paragraph shall apply to the entire personal private
265 passenger motor vehicle insurance policy with limits above the mandatory minimum
266 required by Code Section 33-34-4 and subsection (a) of Code Section 40-9-37 and shall
267 apply to the entire personal private passenger motor vehicle policy with minimum limits
268 if such policy has any additional nonmandatory coverage or coverages.
269 (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, an
270 insurer may, but shall not be required to, file its rate, rating plan, rating system, or
271 underwriting rule for all such personal private passenger motor vehicle insurance
272 provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection under the filing process of
273 paragraph (1) of this subsection.
274 (c) When a rate filing of an insurer required under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this
275 Code section is not accompanied by the information upon which the insurer supports the
276 filing and the Commissioner does not have sufficient information to determine whether the
H. B. 733
- 11 -

25 LC 52 0818
277 filing meets the requirements of this chapter, then the Commissioner shall request in
278 writing, within 20 days of the date he or she receives the filing, the specifics of such
279 additional information as he or she requires, and the insurer shall be required to furnish
280 such information, and in such event the 45 60 day period provided for in paragraph (1) of
281 subsection (b) of this Code section shall commence as of the date such information is
282 furnished.
283 (d) Any domestic, foreign, or alien insurer that is authorized to write insurance in this state
284 must shall file with the Commissioner any rate, rating plan, rating system, or underwriting
285 rule at least 45 60 days prior to any indicated effective date for all insurance other than
286 personal private passenger motor vehicle insurance. No rate, rating plan, rating system, or
287 underwriting rule required to be filed under this subsection will become effective, nor may
288 any premium be collected by any insurer thereunder, unless the filing has been received by
289 the Commissioner in his office not less than 45 60 days prior to its effective date.
290 (e) When a rate filing of an insurer required under subsection (d) of this Code section
291 results in any increase that impacts insurance consumers or policyholders, such insurer
292 shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed actuarial report demonstrating the necessity
293 of the proposed rate increase based on claims trends, risk factors, and financial solvency;
294 a breakdown of administrative expenses, claim costs, and anticipated profit margins; a
295 statement on how the proposed rate increase shall affect policyholders, including families,
296 small businesses, and commercial enterprises in this state; historical past rate changes and
297 corresponding justifications for the preceding five years; and any other documents deemed
298 necessary by the advocate or the Commissioner. When a rate filing of an insurer required
299 under subsection (d) of this Code section results in any overall rate increase of 10 percent
300 or more within any 12 month period, the Commissioner shall order an examination of that
301 insurer to determine the accuracy of the claim reserves, the applicability of the claim
302 reserve practices for the loss data used in support of such filing, and any other component
303 of the rate filing; provided, however, that in the event the overall increase is less than 25
H. B. 733
- 12 -

25 LC 52 0818
304 percent within any 12 month period and the Commissioner affirmatively determines that
305 he or she has sufficient information to evaluate such rate increase and that the cost thereof
306 would not be justified, he or she may waive all or part of such examination. In all other
307 rate filings required under subsection (d) of this Code section, the Commissioner may order
308 an examination of that insurer as provided in this subsection. Such examination shall be
309 conducted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 2 of this title. Upon notification
310 by the Commissioner of his or her intent to conduct such examination, the insurer shall be
311 prohibited from placing the rates so filed in effect until such examination has been
312 reviewed and certified by the Commissioner as being complete. Such examination, if
313 conducted by the Commissioner, shall be reviewed and certified within 90 days of the date
314 such rate, rating plan, rating system, or underwriting rule is filed; provided, however, that
315 if the Commissioner makes an affirmative finding that the examination may not be
316 completed within the 90 day period, he or she may extend such time for one additional 60
317 day period completed and reviewed by the advocate and the Commissioner has approved
318 or disapproved the rate filing. Any examination required under this Code section shall be
319 conducted in accordance with Chapter 2 of this title.
320 (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (d) of this Code section, in the event the
321 filing of any rate, rating plan, rating system, or underwriting rule under subsection (d) of
322 this Code section is not necessary, in the judgment of the Commissioner, to accomplish the
323 purposes of this chapter as set forth in Code Section 33-9-1, then the Commissioner may
324 exempt all domestic, foreign, and alien insurers from being required to file such rate, rating
325 plan, rating system, or underwriting rule.
326 (g) Filings required pursuant to this Code section shall be accompanied by a fee or fees as
327 provided in Code Section 33-8-1.
328 (h) All filings related to rate increases shall be made available on the office's public
329 website within ten days of submission, as provided under Article 4 of Chapter 18 of
330 Title 50."
