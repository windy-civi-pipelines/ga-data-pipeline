15 WHEREAS, Georgia's animal shelters can achieve a 90 percent save rate if more Georgians
16 seeking a pet choose to adopt from a shelter rather than purchase, which would make Georgia
17 the largest state to date with a save rate exceeding 90 percent; and
18 WHEREAS, many Georgia shelters are no-kill, saving at least 90 percent of the animals they
19 intake by implementing proven programs and policies as alternatives, such as foster care
20 networks, adoption programs, medical and behavioral programs, public education and
21 awareness initiatives, community cat trap-neuter-vaccinate-return programs, and animal
22 socialization programs; and
23 WHEREAS, Georgians can work together to achieve "No-Kill" in this state by 2025, and
24 animal shelters can help accomplish this by implementing lifesaving programs and utilizing
25 the support of rescues and nonprofits.
26 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
27 the members of this body commend animal shelter workers and volunteers as well as
28 community members who support their local animal shelters and recognize April 30, 2025,
29 as No-Kill Awareness Day at the state capitol to raise awareness about dog and cat adoption
30 and the importance of "No-Kill" animal shelters.
31 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
32 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
33 public and the press.
