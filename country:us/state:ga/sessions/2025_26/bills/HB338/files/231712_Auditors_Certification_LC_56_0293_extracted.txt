SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
Dear Chairman Carson:
This bill would amend provisions under the Employees' Retirement System by establishing the State
Law Enforcement Officer Plan (Plan). Under the provisions of this bill, members who meet the
definition of 'state law enforcement officer' would be eligible to make an irrevocable election to
participate in this new Plan. Participating members would be required to make contributions
equivalent to five percent of their earnable compensation and would be eligible to receive an enhanced
benefit upon retirement. The amount of the benefit would be dependent on the number of years of
creditable service. However, participating members who retire with 25 years of creditable service
would receive a monthly retirement benefit equivalent to 80 percent of his or her earnable
compensation.
The provisions of this bill would also require the Board of Trustees for the Employees' Retirement
System to establish a Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) Account for participating members
who do not retire after 25 years of service. The monthly benefit that would have been payable to the
member had they retired will be deposited into the DROP Account. The member will be eligible for
all funds deposited with interest upon retirement, in addition to their monthly benefit.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems
Standards Law.
Respectfully,
~ff--•
