16 (b) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, a taxpayer shall be allowed
17 an income tax credit against the tax imposed by this article equal to 20 percent of such
18 taxpayer's eligible construction expenses.
19 (c) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this Code section, in no event shall the total
20 amount of any tax credit allowed to a taxpayer under this Code section for a taxable year
21 exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability. No such tax credit shall be allowed the taxpayer
22 against prior years' tax liability. Any unused tax credit shall be allowed to be carried
23 forward to apply to the taxpayer's next five years' tax liability or transferred pursuant to
24 subsection (d) of this Code section.
25 (d) Any tax credits earned under this Code section by a taxpayer and previously claimed
26 but not used by the taxpayer against the taxpayer's income tax liability may be transferred
27 or sold in whole or in part by such taxpayer to another Georgia taxpayer, subject to the
28 following conditions:
29 (1) Such taxpayer may make only a single transfer or sale of tax credits earned in a
30 taxable year; provided, however, that the transfer or sale may involve one or more
31 transferees;
32 (2) Such taxpayer shall submit to the department a written notification of any transfer or
33 sale of tax credits within 30 days after the transfer or sale of such tax credits. The
34 notification shall include such taxpayer's tax credit balance prior to transfer, the credit
35 certificate number, the remaining balance after transfer, all tax identification numbers for
36 each transferee, the date of transfer, the amount transferred, and any other information
37 required by the department;
38 (3) Failure to comply with this subsection shall result in the disallowance of the tax
39 credit until the taxpayer is in full compliance;
40 (4) The transfer or sale of this tax credit does not extend the time in which such tax credit
41 can be used. The carry-forward period for a tax credit that is transferred or sold shall
42 begin on the date on which the tax credit was originally earned;

45 transferee or recapture the tax credit from the transferee; and
46 (6) The transferee must acquire a minimum of 60 percent of the amount of the tax credits
47 in this Code section so transferred."
