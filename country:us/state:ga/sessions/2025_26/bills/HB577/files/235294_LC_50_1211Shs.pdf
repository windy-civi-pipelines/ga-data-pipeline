257 (a) Any nicotine vapor products offered for sale or sold in violation of this article are

- 11 -

25 LC 50 1211S
272 entitlement to the seized items. The burden of proof at such hearing shall be upon the

282 documents to the superior court within 30 days after the date the petition for review is
283 received. The superior court shall review the record for errors of law, violation of
284 constitutional or statutory provisions, violation of the statutory authority of the agency,
285 lawfulness of the procedure, lack of any evidence to support the commissioner's decision,
286 and arbitrariness and abuse of discretion. However, the court shall not substitute its
287 judgment as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact.
288 (f) The cost of such seizure, forfeiture, storage, and destruction shall be borne by the
289 person from whom the nicotine vapor products determined to be contraband are
290 confiscated.

295 in this state to act as agent for the service of process on whom all process, and any action
296 or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of the enforcement of this article, may
297 be served in any manner authorized by law. Such service shall constitute legal and valid
H. B. 577 (SUB)
- 12 -

25 LC 50 1211S
298 service of process on the vapor product manufacturer. The vapor product manufacturer
299 shall provide the name, address, telephone number, and proof of the appointment and
300 availability of such agent to the commissioner.
301 (b) The vapor product manufacturer shall provide notice to the commissioner 30 days prior
302 to termination of the authority of an agent and shall further provide proof to the satisfaction
303 of the commissioner of the appointment of a new agent no less than five days prior to the

305 appointment, the vapor product manufacturer shall notify the commissioner of the
306 termination within five days and shall include proof to the satisfaction of the commissioner
307 of the appointment of a new agent.
308 (c) Any vapor product manufacturer whose nicotine vapor products are offered for sale or
309 sold in this state that has not appointed and engaged the services of an agent as required by
310 this Code section shall be deemed to have appointed the Secretary of State as its agent for
311 service of process. The appointment of the Secretary of State as agent shall not satisfy the
312 condition precedent required in subsection (a) of this Code section to be included or
313 retained in the directory.
314 48-11-50.
315 Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting the commissioner in the exercise of
316 his or her authority, as provided under Article 1 of this chapter, to suspend or refuse to
317 renew a license for violations of Chapters 13 and 13A of Title 10, Title 16, Title 48, or any
318 other provisions of law and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.
319 48-11-51.
