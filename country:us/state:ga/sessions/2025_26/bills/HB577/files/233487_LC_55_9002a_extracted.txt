281 received. The superior court shall review the record for errors of law, violation of
282 constitutional or statutory provisions, violation of the statutory authority of the agency,
283 lawfulness of the procedure, lack of any evidence to support the commissioner's decision,
284 and arbitrariness and abuse of discretion. However, the court shall not substitute its
285 judgment as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact.
286 (f) The cost of such seizure, forfeiture, storage, and destruction shall be borne by the

293 in this state to act as agent for the service of process on whom all process, and any action
294 or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of the enforcement of this article, may
295 be served in any manner authorized by law. Such service shall constitute legal and valid
296 service of process on the vapor product manufacturer. The vapor product manufacturer
H. B. 577
- 12 -
25 LC 55 9002
297 shall provide the name, address, telephone number, and proof of the appointment and
298 availability of such agent to the commissioner.
299 (b) The vapor product manufacturer shall provide notice to the commissioner 30 days prior
300 to termination of the authority of an agent and shall further provide proof to the satisfaction
301 of the commissioner of the appointment of a new agent no less than five days prior to the

303 appointment, the vapor product manufacturer shall notify the commissioner of the
304 termination within five days and shall include proof to the satisfaction of the commissioner
305 of the appointment of a new agent.
306 (c) Any vapor product manufacturer whose nicotine vapor products are offered for sale or
307 sold in this state that has not appointed and engaged the services of an agent as required by
308 this Code section shall be deemed to have appointed the Secretary of State as its agent for
309 service of process. The appointment of the Secretary of State as agent shall not satisfy the
310 condition precedent required in subsection (a) of this Code section to be included or
311 retained in the directory.
312 48-11-50.
313 Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting the commissioner in the exercise of
314 his or her authority, as provided under Article 1 of this chapter, to suspend or refuse to
315 renew a license for violations of Chapters 13 and 13A of Title 10, Title 16, Title 48, or any
316 other provisions of law and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.
317 48-11-51.
318 Starting on January 31 of the first year after the year in which this article becomes
319 effective, and annually thereafter, the commissioner shall provide a report to the General
320 Assembly regarding the status of the directory, the nicotine vapor products included in the
H. B. 577

321 directory, revenue, and expenditures related to administration of this article, and
322 enforcement activities undertaken pursuant to this article."
323 SECTION 2.
324 This Act shall become effective only if funds are specifically appropriated for the purposes
325 of this Act in an appropriations Act making specific reference to this Act and shall become
326 effective when funds so appropriated become available for expenditure.
327 SECTION 3.

140 such vapor product manufacturer until at least 15 days after the vapor product

294 or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of the enforcement of this article, may
295 be served in any manner authorized by law. Such service shall constitute legal and valid
296 service of process on the vapor product manufacturer. The vapor product manufacturer
H. B. 577

297 shall provide the name, address, telephone number, and proof of the appointment and
298 availability of such agent to the commissioner.

310 condition precedent required in subsection (a) of this Code section to be included or
311 retained in the directory.
312 48-11-50.
313 Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting the commissioner in the exercise of
314 his or her authority, as provided under Article 1 of this chapter, to suspend or refuse to
315 renew a license for violations of Chapters 13 and 13A of Title 10, Title 16, Title 48, or any
316 other provisions of law and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.

325 of this Act in an appropriations Act making specific reference to this Act and shall become
