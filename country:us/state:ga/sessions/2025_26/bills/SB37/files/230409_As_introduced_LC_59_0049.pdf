16 (1) Artificial intelligence ("AI"), the development of computer systems to perform tasks
17 that normally require human intelligence, such as learning and decision making, has the
18 potential to spur innovation and transform industry and government;
19 (2) As the science and technology of AI continue to develop, more products and services
20 are utilizing AI in fields such as healthcare, financial services, education, housing, and
21 transportation. Such utilization may ultimately displace certain jobs and fields of
22 employment;
23 (3) There are valid concerns about potential misuse or unintended consequences of AI,
24 especially without the development and implementation of ethical standards that seek to
25 preserve the dignity, autonomy, and self-determination of individuals;
26 (4) In the 2023 legislative session, at least 25 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of
27 Columbia introduced AI bills, and 18 states and Puerto Rico adopted resolutions or enacted
28 legislation in this area; and
29 (5) It is important that this state establish policies and procedures concerning the
30 development, procurement, implementation, utilization, and ongoing assessment of systems
31 that employ AI and are in use by state agencies.
32 SECTION 3.
33 Chapter 1 of Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to general

42 predicting, acting, or communicating; provided, however, that artificial intelligence
43 systems may vary in the forms of information they can receive and in the human

46 authority, county, municipal corporation, school system, or other political subdivision of
47 this state.
