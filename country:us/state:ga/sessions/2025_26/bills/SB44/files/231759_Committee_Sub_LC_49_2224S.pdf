25 "(d.1) If, after a local school system's equalization grant has been calculated for the
26 ensuing fiscal year as provided for in subsection (b) of this Code section, such local school
27 system decreases the actual or equivalent millage rate levied against its digest for
28 maintenance and operation to an amount below the minimum amount required in
29 subparagraph (a)(9)(C) of this Code section, a midterm adjustment in such local school
30 system's equalization grant shall be made such that the total equalization grant amount
31 awarded to such local school system is reduced to an amount equal to 75 percent of the
32 initial equalization grant amount."
33 "(f) Each year, the Department of Education shall prepare a report of each local school
34 system that received an equalization grant the previous fiscal year. Such report shall
35 include for each local school system the initial equalization grant amount, the midterm
36 adjustment to the equalization grant, and the total amount of equalization grants received
37 in the previous ten years. Such report shall also identify each local school system that
38 received an equalization grant during the previous fiscal year while having a millage rate
39 or an equivalent millage rate of less than 10 mills for the period of time upon which the
40 calculation of such equalization grant was based. Each year, no later than September 1, the
