17 powers provided for in Code Section 45-15-19. The Senate and the House of
18 Representatives may, through joint resolution or joint rules of procedure, authorize one or

20 Section 45-15-19.
21 (b) For the purpose of conducting any investigation, a committee that has been authorized
22 to exercise investigatory powers pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section shall have
23 the power to administer oaths; to call any party to testify under oath at such investigation;
24 to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, records, and papers; and
25 to take the depositions of witnesses. For such purposes, the committee is authorized to
26 issue a subpoena for any witness or a subpoena to compel the production of any books,
27 records, or papers consistent with the rules of procedure or resolution enabling such
28 committee. A subpoena issued under this Code section may be served at any place in this
29 state and in any manner authorized in Code Section 24-13-24.
30 (c) When authorized by the rules of procedure or resolution enabling such committee, the
31 confidential treatment of material and information in the course of investigations and other
32 proceedings of such committee shall be recognized by law. Such confidential treatment
33 shall be preserved in proceedings under this Code section and as provided in paragraph (2)
34 of subsection (d) of this Code section.
35 (d)(1) In case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued under this Code section to any person
36 and upon application by the committee that has been authorized to exercise investigatory
37 powers pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section, the superior court in whose
38 jurisdiction the witness is to appear or in which the books, records, or papers are to be
39 produced may issue to that person an order requiring him or her to appear before the court
40 to show cause why he or she should not be held in contempt for refusal to obey the
41 subpoena. Failure to obey a subpoena may be punished by the court as contempt of court.
42 (2) If the application for a subpoena requests confidential treatment, the court shall take
43 any and all steps necessary or appropriate to preserve the confidentiality of the

44 application. The court may, but shall not be required to, issue the subpoena in such a
45 manner as to preserve its confidentiality. If the court determines that a subpoena may be
46 issued but confidential treatment is not warranted under the rules of procedure or
47 resolution enabling such committee, the judge shall so notify the chairperson or acting
48 chairperson; and the chairperson or acting chairperson shall then have the option to:
49 (A) Abandon the request for a subpoena, in which case the application shall remain
50 confidential; or
51 (B) Accept the determination of the court, in which case the subpoena shall issue, but
52 the application and the issuance shall not be treated as confidential.
53 (e) Nothing in this Code section, Code Section 28-1-16, Code Section 45-15-17, or Code
54 Section 45-15-19, or in any other section of this Code, is intended to, or shall be interpreted
55 as, abrogating, modifying, superseding, or in any other way limiting any authority,
56 immunity, privilege, or power granted to or possessed by the General Assembly, the
57 Senate, the House of Representatives, any committee of either chamber, any joint
58 committee, and the members thereof, whether explicitly or implicitly, by the Constitution,
59 the rules of procedure of either chamber, statutory law, decisional law, or common law and
60 the General Assembly expressly intends to preserve all such authority, immunity, privilege,
61 and power. Nor is this Code section in any way intended to, or shall be interpreted as,
62 abrogating, modifying, superseding, or in any limiting any investigations by, or powers of,
63 any committees of the Senate or the House of Representatives that were authorized, or to
64 any subpoenas issued by or other actions taken by any such committee, prior to the
65 effective date of this Code section."
