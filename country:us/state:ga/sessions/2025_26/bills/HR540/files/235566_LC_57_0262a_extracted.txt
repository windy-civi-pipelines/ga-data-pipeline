Section 1:
25 LC 57 0262
House Resolution 540
Henderson of the 113th
A RESOLUTION
1 Urging the Congress of the United States to adopt legislation requiring the Medicare program
2 to provide for lifelong coverage of immunosuppressive drugs for liver, heart, and lung
3 transplant recipients; and for other purposes.
4 WHEREAS, over 20,000 kidney transplants are performed annually in the United States,
5 along with approximately 9,000 liver transplants, 3,500 heart transplants, and 2,500 lung
6 transplants, saving lives and significantly reducing healthcare costs associated with chronic
7 diseases; and
8 WHEREAS, absent eligible kidney transplant recipients, Medicare coverage of
9 immunosuppressive drugs is limited to 36 months following a transplant, leaving many
10 recipients without access to critical medications necessary to sustain their transplanted
11 organs, increasing their risk of organ rejection, costly hospitalizations, and a return to dialysis
12 treatment; and
13 WHEREAS, annually, dialysis treatment costs Medicare approximately $90,000.00 per
14 patient, while immunosuppressive medications only cost between $10,000.00 and $15,000.00
15 per patient, demonstrating the financial efficiency of providing comprehensive lifelong
16 immunosuppressive medication coverage; and

25 LC 57 0262
17 WHEREAS, lifelong Medicare coverage for organ transplant recipients improves health
18 outcomes, supports workforce reintegration, reduces healthcare disparities, and enhances the
19 emotional and psychological well-being of recipients; and
20 WHEREAS, such lifelong Medicare coverage for organ transplant recipients promotes equity
21 by addressing healthcare disparities, particularly in underserved and rural communities, while
22 aligning with national healthcare goals to ensure accessible, sustainable, and high-quality
23 care for all patients.
24 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF
25 GEORGIA that the members of this body urge the Congress of the United States to adopt
26 legislation requiring the Medicare program to provide for lifelong coverage of
27 immunosuppressive drugs for liver, heart, and lung transplant recipients in the same manner
28 as for kidney transplant recipients.
29 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Georgia supports initiatives that expand access to
30 post-transplant care, reduce healthcare costs, and promote equity in the healthcare system
31 through federal and state policies.
32 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
33 and directed to transmit appropriate copies of this resolution to the President of the United
34 States, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the President of the United
35 States Senate, and the members of the Georgia Congressional delegation.
