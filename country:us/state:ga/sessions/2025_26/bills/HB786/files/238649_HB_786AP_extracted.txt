192 SECTION 7.
193 Trust agreement.
194 In the discretion of the authority, any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by an
195 agreement or indenture made by the authority with a corporate trustee, which may be any
196 trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without this state.
197 Such trust agreement or indenture may pledge and assign rents, fees, charges, revenues, and
198 earnings to be received by the authority. The resolution providing for the issuance of
199 revenue bonds and such trust agreements or indenture may contain provisions for protecting
200 and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders, including the right of appointment
201 of a receiver upon default of the payment of any principal or interest obligation and the right
202 of any receiver or trustee to enforce collection of any rents, fees, charges, or revenues for use
203 of the project or projects necessary to pay all costs of operation and all reserves provided for,
204 all principal and interest on all bonds of the issue, all costs of collection, and all other costs
205 reasonably necessary to accomplish the collection of such sums in the event of any default
206 of the authority. Such resolution and such trust agreement or indenture may include
207 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property for
208 and construction of the project and to the custody, safeguarding, and application of all funds
209 and covenants providing for the operation, maintenance, repair, and insurance of the project
210 or projects and may contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which
211 additional revenue bonds may be issued. Such trust agreement or indenture may set forth the
212 rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right
213 of action of bondholders as is customary in securing bonds and debentures of corporations
214 and may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for
215 the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust may be
216 treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by
217 such trust.

233 Revenue bond validation.
234 The petition for validation of all revenue bonds of the authority shall be brought against the
235 authority, and any contracting party whose obligation is pledged as security for the payment
236 of the bonds sought to be validated, as defendants, and the defendants shall be required to
237 show cause, if any exists, as to why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions
238 thereof shall not be adjudicated to be in all respects valid and binding upon such contracting
239 parties. It shall be incumbent upon such defendants to defend against adjudication of the
H. B. 786

241 of such proceedings shall be included in the notice of the validation hearing required to be
242 issued and published by the clerk of the Superior Court of Dodge County in which court such
243 validation proceedings shall be initiated.
244 SECTION 11.
245 Interest of bondholders protected.
246 While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or
247 existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished,
248 impaired, or affected in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the
249 holders of such bonds. The provisions of this section shall be for the benefit of the authority
250 and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of
251 this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.

183 payable from the rentals, revenue, earnings, and funds of the authority as provided in the
184 resolution, trust agreement, or indenture authorizing the issuance and securing the payment
185 of such bonds. The issuance of such bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently

187 payment thereof. No holder of any bond or receiver or trustee in connection therewith shall
188 have the right to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state or of said
189 county, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable,

191 substantially the foregoing provisions of this section.

192 SECTION 7.
193 Trust agreement.
194 In the discretion of the authority, any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by an
195 agreement or indenture made by the authority with a corporate trustee, which may be any
196 trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without this state.
197 Such trust agreement or indenture may pledge and assign rents, fees, charges, revenues, and
198 earnings to be received by the authority. The resolution providing for the issuance of
199 revenue bonds and such trust agreements or indenture may contain provisions for protecting
200 and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders, including the right of appointment
201 of a receiver upon default of the payment of any principal or interest obligation and the right
202 of any receiver or trustee to enforce collection of any rents, fees, charges, or revenues for use
203 of the project or projects necessary to pay all costs of operation and all reserves provided for,
204 all principal and interest on all bonds of the issue, all costs of collection, and all other costs
205 reasonably necessary to accomplish the collection of such sums in the event of any default
206 of the authority. Such resolution and such trust agreement or indenture may include
207 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property for
208 and construction of the project and to the custody, safeguarding, and application of all funds
209 and covenants providing for the operation, maintenance, repair, and insurance of the project
210 or projects and may contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which
211 additional revenue bonds may be issued. Such trust agreement or indenture may set forth the
212 rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right
213 of action of bondholders as is customary in securing bonds and debentures of corporations
214 and may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for
215 the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust may be
216 treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by
217 such trust.

223 refunding bonds all interest and any call premiums that may be required for the redemption
224 and refunding of such outstanding bonds.
225 SECTION 9.
226 Venue of actions, jurisdiction.
227 Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any action

229 Superior Court of Dodge County, Georgia; and any action pertaining to validation of any
230 bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall be brought in said court, which shall have
231 exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.
232 SECTION 10.
233 Revenue bond validation.
234 The petition for validation of all revenue bonds of the authority shall be brought against the
235 authority, and any contracting party whose obligation is pledged as security for the payment
236 of the bonds sought to be validated, as defendants, and the defendants shall be required to
237 show cause, if any exists, as to why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions
238 thereof shall not be adjudicated to be in all respects valid and binding upon such contracting
239 parties. It shall be incumbent upon such defendants to defend against adjudication of the
H. B. 786

241 of such proceedings shall be included in the notice of the validation hearing required to be
242 issued and published by the clerk of the Superior Court of Dodge County in which court such
243 validation proceedings shall be initiated.
244 SECTION 11.
245 Interest of bondholders protected.
246 While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or
247 existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished,
248 impaired, or affected in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the
249 holders of such bonds. The provisions of this section shall be for the benefit of the authority
250 and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of
251 this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.
252 SECTION 12.

255 construction of the project or projects of the authority with revenue bonds, the authority is

257 which it shall cause to be acquired or constructed. Such rents, fees, or charges to be paid for

273 bonds or may be dictated by the requirements of such resolution, trust agreement, or
274 indenture, or of achieving ready marketability of and low interest rates on such bonds;
