16 licensed professional, who shall be named in the lease agreement or identified by the
17 landlord at the time the premises is rented, or through any licensed professional if no such
18 professional is preapproved by the landlord. After the work is completed, the tenant may

42 day the tenant was served with the summons pursuant to Code Section 44-7-51, all rents
43 allegedly owed plus the cost of the dispossessory warrant. Such a tender shall be a
