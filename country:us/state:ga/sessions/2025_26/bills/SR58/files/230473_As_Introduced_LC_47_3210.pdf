12 "SECTION IV.
13 LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL REAPPORTIONMENT
14 Paragraph I. Citizens' Redistricting Commission. (a) In each year following a year in
15 which a United States decennial census is conducted or when congressional or legislative
S. R. 58
- 1 -

25 LC 47 3210
16 redistricting is required by court order, the state's congressional districts and Senate and
17 House of Representative districts shall be reapportioned in accordance with this
18 Constitution and the United States Constitution. The state shall be reapportioned into a
19 number of congressional districts equal to the number of congressional districts allocated
20 to the state under the United States Constitution and federal law. The state shall also be
21 reapportioned into not less than 30 nor more than 56 consecutively numbered senatorial
22 districts and into not less than 120 nor more than 180 consecutively numbered
23 representative districts. The term 'reapportionment,' as used in this section, means any
24 redistricting process by which congressional and legislative district boundaries are
25 established and the term 'reapportionment plan,' as used in this section, means any plan that
26 implements any redistricting process.
27 (b) In establishing district boundaries, the following exclusive standards shall govern:
28 (1) Districts shall comply with the United States Constitution, the federal Voting
29 Rights Act of 1965, as amended, and other applicable laws of the United States;
30 (2) Districts shall not be drawn with the intent or result of denying or abridging the
31 right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or
32 language-minority status. A district does not satisfy this standard if, based on the totality
33 of circumstances, the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or
34 political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of
35 citizens protected by this Paragraph, in that its members have less opportunity than other
36 members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect
37 representatives of their choice, whether as a single group or acting in concert with others.
38 Any voter who is a member of such a class and who resides in a political subdivision
39 where a violation of this subparagraph (b)(2) is alleged may file an action in the superior
40 court of the county in which the political subdivision is located;
41 (3) Districts shall be geographically contiguous;

25 LC 47 3210
42 (4) Plans, if for congressional redistricting, shall provide for zero deviation of total
43 population per district and, if for redistricting of the House of Representatives or the
44 Senate, shall provide for as close as practicable to zero deviation of total population
45 among the districts, consistent with the standards set forth in this Paragraph;
46 (5) District boundaries shall conform to existing county geographical boundaries to the
47 extent practicable and to the extent there is no conflict with the standards set forth in this
48 Paragraph;
49 (6) Districts shall not breach precinct boundaries, and any agency or body authorized
50 to create new precinct boundaries shall not breach district boundaries;
51 (7) Except as otherwise required by this Paragraph:
52 (A) No reapportionment plan or district shall be drawn with the intent to favor or
53 disfavor a political party, incumbent, or other person or group; and
54 (B) No reapportionment plan or district shall be drawn on the basis of maps existing
55 prior to the enactment of this Paragraph; and
56 (8) No use shall be made of any of the following data: residential addresses of
57 incumbent legislators, perceived or actual political affiliations of registered voters, past
58 election results, voting history data, or any demographic information other than
59 population head counts.
60 (c)(1) In each year following a year in which a United States decennial census is
61 conducted or when congressional or legislative redistricting is required by court order,
62 a Citizens' Redistricting Commission shall be established as provided in this Paragraph.
63 The Citizens' Redistricting Commission shall be the reapportionment body responsible
64 for congressional and legislative redistricting.
65 (2) The commission shall be composed of 14 members appointed as provided in this
66 Paragraph.
67 (3) The commission shall include five members who are identified with the political
68 party whose candidate for Governor in the last general election to fill the office of

70 political party whose candidate for Governor in the last general election to fill the office
71 of Governor received the next highest number of votes, and four members who are not
72 identified with any political party. Identification with a political party shall mean that a
73 person voted in the general primary of such political party in each of the three
74 immediately preceding general primaries and publicly swears or affirms that he or she
75 supports the political party and personally identifies as a member of the political party.
76 Not being identified with a political party shall mean that the person did not vote
77 exclusively in the general primary of one political party in the three immediately
78 preceding general primaries and publicly swears or affirms that he or she does not
79 personally identify as a member of any political party.
80 (4) Each commission member shall be a registered voter who, at the time of his or her
81 selection to serve on the commission, has been continuously registered to vote in Georgia
82 for the immediately preceding five-year period or longer and has voted in each of the

100 price index for Georgia or its successor index over the preceding ten-year period.
101 Immediate family members include spouses, parents, siblings, and children.
102 (6) Not later than January 1, 2030, and in each year ending in the number zero
103 thereafter, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall initiate an application process for
104 service on the commission which shall be open to all registered electors in Georgia in a
105 manner that promotes a diverse and qualified applicant pool reflecting the diverse
106 demographics and geography of the state. Such applications shall be received through
107 June 30 of such year and in each year ending in the number zero thereafter. Not later
108 than July 1 of such year and in each year ending in the number zero thereafter, the Chief
109 Justice shall establish a review panel consisting of three retired appellate or superior court
110 judges to screen applicants for the commission. Not later than August 1 of such year and
111 in each year ending in the number zero thereafter, the Chief Justice shall publicize the
112 names of the applicants and deliver copies of their applications to the review panel.
113 (7) The review panel shall review and verify the qualifications of the applicants and
114 shall select 20 of the most qualified applicants who are identified with the political party
115 whose candidate for Governor in the last general election to fill the office of Governor
116 received the highest number of votes, 20 of the most qualified applicants who are
117 identified with the political party whose candidate for Governor in the last general
118 election to fill the office of Governor received the next highest number of votes, and 20
119 of the most qualified applicants who are not identified with any political party. These
120 subpools shall be created on the basis of relevant analytical skills, ability to be impartial,
121 and appreciation of the diverse demographics and geography of the state. The members
122 of the review panel shall not communicate with any member of the Georgia congressional
S. R. 58
- 5 -

25 LC 47 3210
123 delegation, any member of the General Assembly, or any representative of any such
124 member prior to the selection of the three subpools of applicants.
125 (8) Not later than October 1, 2030, and in each year ending in the number zero
126 thereafter, the review panel shall submit the three subpools of applicants to the Secretary
127 of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Not later than
128 November 15, 2030, and in each year ending in the number zero thereafter, the President
129 Pro Tempore of the Senate, the minority leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House
130 of Representatives, and the minority leader of the House of Representatives may each
131 strike up to two of the applicants from each subpool for a total of up to eight strikes from
132 each subpool. After removing the names of those persons stricken from the subpools, the
133 Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives shall deliver the
134 pool of remaining names to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
135 (9) Not later than November 20, 2030, and in each year ending in the number zero
136 thereafter, the Chief Justice shall randomly draw eight names from the applicants
137 remaining. Three of the randomly drawn names shall be drawn from the subpool of
138 applicants who identify with the political party whose candidate for Governor in the last
139 general election to fill the office of Governor received the highest number of votes, three
140 of the randomly drawn names shall be drawn from the subpool of applicants who identify
141 with the political party whose candidate for Governor in the last general election to fill
142 the office of Governor received the next highest number of votes, and two of the
143 randomly drawn names shall be drawn from the subpool of applicants who do not identify
144 with any political party. These persons shall serve on the commission.
145 (10) Not later than December 31, 2030, and in each year ending in the number zero
146 thereafter, the initial eight members of the commission selected as provided in
147 subparagraph (c)(9) of this Paragraph shall review the names remaining in the pool of
148 applicants following their selection and shall appoint an additional six persons from such
149 remaining applicants. Two names shall be selected from the subpool of applicants who

150 identify with the political party whose candidate for Governor in the last general election
151 to fill the office of Governor received the highest number of votes, two names shall be

153 candidate for Governor in the last general election to fill the office of Governor received
154 the next highest number of votes, and two names shall be selected from the subpool of
155 applicants who do not identify with any political party. The six appointees must receive
156 the affirmative vote of at least five of the initial eight members of the commission, which
157 shall include at least two votes by members of the commission who identify with one of
158 the political parties and one vote by a member of the commission who does not identify
159 with any political party. Such additional sixth member of the commission shall be chosen
160 to represent the state's diversity to include, but not be limited to, racial, ethnic,
161 geographic, and gender diversity, provided that no formula or specific ratio shall be used
162 for such purpose. Such members of the commission shall also be chosen for their
163 analytical skills and ability to be impartial.
164 (11) In the event of substantial neglect of duty, gross misconduct in office, or inability
165 to discharge the duties of the office, a member of the commission may be removed by the
166 review panel established by the Chief Justice pursuant to subparagraph (c)(6) of this
167 Paragraph after having been served with written notice and provided with an opportunity
168 for responding.
169 (12) Vacancies on the commission shall be filled within 30 days following the
170 occurrence of such vacancy by the remaining members of the commission by selecting
171 a person from the same subpool of applicants from which the vacating member was
172 selected as such subpool existed on November 20 of the year in which that pool was
173 established. In the event that none of the remaining applicants are available for service,
174 the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall create a new subpool following the general
175 methodology of this subparagraph (c).

187 competent staff, in order for the commission to carry out its duties. The General
188 Assembly shall provide adequate funding for the representation of the commission in any
189 litigation, and the Department of Law shall have the responsibility for such
190 representation. The commission shall have legal standing to seek judicial relief from the
191 Supreme Court should the General Assembly fail to satisfy the requirements of this
192 Paragraph. The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction to hear such actions and
193 may appoint a special master to take testimony and evidence and determine factual issues
194 necessary to resolve such actions.
195 (d)(1) Before January 1 of a reapportionment year, a publicly accessible internet based
196 redistricting portal shall be established to assist the public in drawing maps and providing

198 own maps. Such portal shall allow any member of the public to submit written comments
199 on any proposed plans.
200 (2) Not later than April 15 of a reapportionment year, one or more initial proposed

205 all data necessary for a third party to electronically recreate an accurate visual
206 representation of such proposed plan or plans. The plan or plans shall be presented in a
207 manner that will allow any member of the public to immediately inspect visually the

214 bases used to create such plan or plans, draft maps, formulae or algorithms, and any
215 hardware or software relied upon to create such plan or plans. This subparagraph (d)(3)
216 shall be construed to defeat any legal claim or defense that is brought or raised by any
217 party to prevent the disclosure of such procedure or process, including, but not limited
218 to, a claim or defense that such disclosure would constitute an unlawful disclosure of a
219 trade secret or other confidential or proprietary information.
220 (4) There shall be at least one public hearing in the highest-population municipality of
221 each congressional district in this state, to be held no earlier than May 1 and no later than

233 (5) Not later than July 1 of a reapportionment year, all public comments submitted in

245 public for inspection and copying.
246 (8) All communications with any party not hired or contracted to perform, or not

252 apply to this Paragraph or any other such applicable laws.
253 (10) A plaintiff interested in having the duties or prohibitions set forth in this
254 Paragraph enforced may seek a writ of mandamus to compel due performance of the
255 duties set forth in this Paragraph or writ of prohibition, whichever is proper. A writ of
S. R. 58
- 10 -

25 LC 47 3210
256 prohibition shall be permitted to enforce the prohibitions set forth in this Paragraph. Lack
257 of clarity or specificity shall not constitute a defense in any such actions.
258 (e)(1) Within 15 days after the final reapportionment plan is certified to the Secretary of
259 State, any citizen of this state may petition the Supreme Court of Georgia for a
260 declaratory judgment determining the validity of the reapportionment under the standards
261 set forth in subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph. The Supreme Court shall have original
262 jurisdiction of such actions and may appoint a special master to take testimony and
263 evidence and determine factual issues necessary to resolve such actions. The Supreme
264 Court, in accordance with its rules, shall permit adversary interests to present their views
265 and, within 60 days from the filing of the petition, shall enter its judgment. Should no
266 petition be filed, the reapportionment plan shall take effect.
267 (2) A judgment of the Supreme Court determining the reapportionment to be valid shall
268 be binding upon all the citizens of the state. Should the Supreme Court determine that
269 the reapportionment is invalid, the reapportionment body shall reconvene within five days
270 thereafter and, within 15 consecutive days, revise the reapportionment plan to conform
271 to the judgment of the Supreme Court, and certify such second reapportionment to the
272 Secretary of State.
273 (3) Within 15 days after such second reapportionment is certified, any citizen of this
274 state may petition the Supreme Court for a declaratory judgment determining the validity
275 of the second reapportionment under the standards set forth in subparagraph (b) of this
276 Paragraph. Consideration of the validity of the second reapportionment shall be had as
277 provided for in subparagraph (e)(1) of this Paragraph. Should no petition be filed, the
278 second reapportionment plan shall take effect.
279 (4) Should no second reapportionment be certified within the time limit, or should the
280 Supreme Court determine that such second reapportionment is invalid, the court shall, not
281 later than 60 days after receiving the petition, file with the Secretary of State an order
282 making such reapportionment.
