1012 (c) Whenever in opening, extending or widening any street, avenue, alley or public place of
1013 the city, a small parcel or tract of land is cut-off or separated by such work from a larger tract
1014 or boundary of land owned by the city, the city council may authorize the city manager to sell
1015 and convey said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining
1016 property owner or owners where such sale and conveyance facilitates the enjoyment of the
1017 highest and best use of the abutting owner's property. Included in the sales contract shall be

1019 property owner shall be notified of the availability of the property and given the opportunity
1020 to purchase said property under such terms and conditions as set out by ordinance. All deeds
1021 and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title and
