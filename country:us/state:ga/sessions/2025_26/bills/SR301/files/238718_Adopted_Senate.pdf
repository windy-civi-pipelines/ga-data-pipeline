A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the Senate Rosenwald Schools Study Committee; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, in the early 1900s, Julius Rosenwald, one of the early presidents and part owner
3 of Sears, Roebuck and Co., partnered with Booker T. Washington, a Black educator and
4 leader, to fund construction of schools in poor, rural African American school districts across
5 the South; and
6 WHEREAS, Rosenwald schools were cooperatively built with donations of land and labor
7 from the local communities and matching financial contributions from the Rosenwald
8 Foundation; and
9 WHEREAS, the foundation helped fund the construction of almost 5,000 schools for Black
10 children around the South, which helped lift generations of African Americans out of
11 poverty; and
12 WHEREAS, the program provided funding for more than 240 Rosenwald schools in 103 of
13 Georgia's 159 counties, and at least 35,000 children attended those schools; and

14 WHEREAS, school integration brought an end to operation of the Rosenwald schools,
15 though many continued to serve their communities long after; and
16 WHEREAS, Rosenwald and Washington's program dramatically transformed the country
17 by profoundly reshaping the African American experience, yet its scope and impact are
18 largely unknown and remain hidden history; and
19 WHEREAS, the history of Rosenwald schools in Georgia and their impact on the education
20 and economic prosperity of African Americans in the state is deserving of study.
