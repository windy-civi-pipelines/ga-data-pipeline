House Resolution 756
Clark of the 108th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Encouraging the General Assembly to preserve access to safety and justice for all survivors
2 of gender-based violence and human trafficking by adopting language that ensures protection
3 for immigrant survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other
4 crimes to safely report to and assist law enforcement, and to prevent the assistance from law
5 enforcement from being used as a tool of control and abuse; and for other purposes.
6 WHEREAS, Georgia is home to a diverse immigrant population where one out of every ten
7 Georgia residents is an immigrant and one in 13 Georgia residents is U.S. born with at least
8 one immigrant parent; and
9 WHEREAS, immigrant survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking,
10 and other crimes often face significant barriers to safety, including fear of escalated violence,
11 threats of deportation, and language access; and
12 WHEREAS, immigrants experience abuse at twice the rate of the general U.S. population,
13 and when married to a U.S. citizen, the rate of abuse is three times higher; and
14 WHEREAS, Georgia ranks third nationally in detained immigrant populations, which
15 contributes to an environment of fear among immigrant communities; and

25 LC 48 1617
16 WHEREAS, survivors who fear criminalization are less likely to report crime, and it is a
17 common tactic of power and control for abusers to keep immigrant survivors of
18 domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking silent by threatening to call U.S.
19 Immigration and Customs Enforcement and have them deported; and
20 WHEREAS, if detained and deported, key witnesses and victims of crime in Georgia will no
21 longer be available to local law enforcement as they seek to crack down on human trafficking
22 and domestic violence crimes; and
23 WHEREAS, data shows that when laws like HB 1105 are passed, immigrant survivors of
24 human trafficking and other forms of gender-based violence become even more afraid to
25 leave their homes to seek safety and shelter for fear of being profiled by law enforcement.
26 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
27 the members of this body encourage the preservation and access to safety and justice for all
28 survivors of gender-based violence and human trafficking by adopting language that ensures
29 protection for immigrant survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking,
30 and other crimes to safely report to law enforcement.
31 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
32 and directed to make an appropriate copy of this resolution available for distribution to the
33 General Assembly.
