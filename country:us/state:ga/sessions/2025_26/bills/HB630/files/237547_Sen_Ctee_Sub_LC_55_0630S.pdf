434 specifically named consumers for violations of this chapter shall be recoverable by a civil
435 action brought by the division, the board, the Attorney General, or any district attorney,
436 solicitor-general, or municipal or county attorney in any superior or state court having
437 proper jurisdiction. The proceeds of any civil penalty shall be remitted to the board by the
438 clerk of the court in which such case is filed; provided, however, that in an action brought
439 on behalf of a county or municipality one-half of the proceeds of such civil penalty shall
440 be paid into the treasury of such county or municipality. The court shall order any
