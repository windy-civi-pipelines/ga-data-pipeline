A RESOLUTION

4 acquisition of literacy skills; and for other purposes.
5 WHEREAS, a significant percentage of school age children, approximately one-third,
6 experience vision problems, yet for many of them the lack of vision screening and necessary
7 follow-up diagnostic evaluations are impairing their ability to acquire literacy skills; and
8 WHEREAS, hearing screening is only required as a newborn before hospital discharge and
9 at entry into a school system, and vision screening is only required at entry into a school
10 system; and
11 WHEREAS, eight percent of children have hearing loss between six and 19 years of age; and
12 WHEREAS, there is a well documented direct link between vision and hearing health and
13 the acquisition of literacy skills; and
