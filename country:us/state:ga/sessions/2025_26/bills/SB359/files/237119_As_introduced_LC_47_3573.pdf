21 ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the officials and employees of Henry
22 County in situations where a conflict may exist.
23 (2) The General Assembly recognizes that an appropriate and effective code of ethics for
24 appointed officials and employees of Henry County is also essential for the proper
25 administration and operation of the Henry County government.
