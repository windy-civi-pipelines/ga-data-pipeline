142 disagreement as to whether any reimbursement under subparagraph (C)
143 of this paragraph shall be made for other reasonable expenses directly

71 made for any postage which is used for a political newsletter. No
72 reimbursement shall be paid for lodging or meals for any day for which
73 a member receives the daily expense allowance as provided in this
74 paragraph. Eligible expenses shall be reimbursed following the
75 submission of vouchers to the legislative fiscal office in compliance with
76 the requirements of this subparagraph and subject to the provisions of
77 subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. Such vouchers shall be submitted in
78 such form and manner as prescribed by the Legislative Services
79 Committee pursuant to subparagraph (E) of this paragraph, provided that
80 each such voucher shall be accompanied by a supporting document or
81 documents, or legible copies thereof, showing payment for each expense
82 claimed or an explanation of the absence of such documentation; in
83 addition, each such voucher shall include a certification by the member
84 that the information contained in such voucher and supporting document
85 or documents, or legible copies thereof, is true and correct and that such
86 expenses were incurred by the member. The provisions of Code
87 Section 16-10-20 shall be applicable to any person submitting such
88 certified vouchers and supporting documents or copies the same as if the
89 General Assembly were a department or agency of state government. No
90 such voucher or supporting document shall be required for per diem
91 differential.
92 (D) The amount of per diem differential which may be claimed for each
93 day under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph shall be the difference
94 between the daily expense allowance authorized for members of the
95 General Assembly and $119.00; provided, however, that the General

96 Appropriations Act for any fiscal year may increase such amount
97 of $119.00 per day to an amount not in excess of the federal per diem rate
98 then in effect for the state capital as specified by the General Services
99 Administration. Per diem differential shall be paid by the legislative
100 fiscal office to the member upon the member's notification to the
101 legislative fiscal office of the days for which the daily expense allowance
102 was received for which the member wishes to claim the per diem
103 differential, and the legislative fiscal office shall keep a record of the
104 days for which per diem differential is so claimed and paid.
105 (E) For the purposes of this paragraph, a year shall begin on the
106 convening date of the General Assembly in regular session each year and
107 end on the day prior to the convening of the General Assembly in the
108 next calendar year. Any voucher or claim for any reimbursement for any
109 year as defined in this paragraph shall be submitted no later than the
110 fifteenth of April immediately following the end of such year. No
111 reimbursement shall be made on any voucher or claim submitted after
112 that date. Any amounts remaining in such expense account at the end of
113 the first year of the two-year biennium may be claimed for expenses
114 incurred during the second year of the two-year biennium. Any amounts
115 remaining in any expense account which are not so claimed by April 15
116 of the year following the second year of the biennium and any amounts
117 claimed which are returned as hereafter provided for in this paragraph
118 shall lapse and shall be remitted by the legislative fiscal office to the
119 general fund of the state treasury. Any former member of the General
120 Assembly may be reimbursed for expenses incurred while a member of
121 the General Assembly upon compliance with the provisions of this
122 paragraph. The Legislative Services Committee is empowered to provide

25 LC 47 3171/AP
123 such procedures as it deems advisable to administer the provisions of this
124 paragraph, including, but not limited to, definitions of the above list of
125 items for which reimbursement may be made; provided, however, that
126 the term 'other reasonable expenditures directly related to the
127 performance of a member's duties' shall be as defined by policies adopted
128 by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and by the Senate
129 Administrative Affairs Committee as to reimbursement of such
130 expenditures incurred by members of the House and Senate, respectively;
131 and provided, further, that the amount of expenses which may be
132 reimbursed within the limits of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph for
133 travel outside the state may be as provided by policies adopted by the
134 Speaker of the House of Representatives and by the Senate
135 Administrative Affairs Committee as to such expenditures of members
136 of the House and Senate, respectively. The Legislative Services
137 Committee is further empowered to prescribe the form of the voucher or
138 claim which must be submitted to the legislative fiscal office. In the
139 event of any disagreement as to whether any reimbursement shall be
140 made or any allowance shall be paid, the Legislative Services Committee
141 shall make the final determination; except that in the event of any
142 disagreement as to whether any reimbursement under subparagraph (C)
143 of this paragraph shall be made for other reasonable expenses directly
144 related to the performance of a member's duties or for travel outside the
145 state, the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall make the final
146 determination as to such expenses incurred by a member of the House,
147 and the Senate Administrative Affairs Committee shall make the final
148 determination as to such expenses incurred by a member of the Senate.
149 In the event any reimbursement is made or any allowance is paid and it

150 is later determined that such reimbursement or payment was made in
151 error, the person to whom such reimbursement or payment was made
152 shall remit to the legislative fiscal office the amount of money involved.
153 In the event any such person refuses to make such remittance, the
154 legislative fiscal office is authorized to withhold the payment of any
155 other moneys to which such person is entitled until the amount of such
156 reimbursement or payment which was made in error shall be realized.
157 (23) Speaker of the House of Representatives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17,800.00
158 The Speaker of the House of Representatives shall also receive the salary

161 convening day of the regular session of the General Assembly in 1983, the
162 annual salary of the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall
163 become $22,800.00. After such date, the Speaker shall also receive as
164 additional salary a sum equal to the amount of salary over $30,000.00 per
165 annum which is received by the Lieutenant Governor as of that date or
166 thereafter; and the salary of the Speaker shall be adjusted at the beginning
167 of each term so as to include such additional sum.

178 members of the General Assembly, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the
179 President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House of

182 from time to time be granted to employees of the executive, judicial, and legislative
183 branches of government. However, any increase for such officials shall not include
184 within-grade step increases for which employees subject to compensation plans authorized
185 and approved in accordance with Code Section 45-20-4 are eligible. Any increase granted
186 pursuant to this subsection shall become effective at the same time that funds are made
187 available for the increase for such employees, except increases for members and
188 member-officers of the General Assembly. That portion of the increase determined by the
189 Legislative Services Committee to reflect a cost-of-living increase based upon objective
190 economic criteria shall become effective for members and member-officers at the same
191 time that funds are made available for the increase for such employees. The balance of the
192 increase for members and member-officers of the General Assembly shall become effective
193 on the convening of the next General Assembly in January of the next odd-numbered year.
194 The Office of Planning and Budget shall calculate the average percentage increase.

196 each state official listed in subsection (a) of this Code section who:
197 (1) Is not a member of the General Assembly; and
198 (2) Is not a contributing member of a state retirement system and, therefore, does not
199 benefit by or participate in any program whereunder a portion of the employee
200 contributions to the state retirement system are made on behalf of the employee by the
201 employer.
