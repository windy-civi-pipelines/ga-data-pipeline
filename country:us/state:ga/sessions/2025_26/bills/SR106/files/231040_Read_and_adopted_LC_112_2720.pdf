A RESOLUTION
1 Honoring the memory of Mrs. Rosa Parks and recognizing February 4, 2025, as Rosa Parks
2 Day at the state capitol; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, on December 1, 1955, seamstress Rosa Parks became a beacon of courage and
4 a symbol of the Civil Rights Movement when she refused to give up her seat on a city bus
5 to a white passenger, accepting arrest, trial, and conviction rather than humiliation; and
6 WHEREAS, her quiet insistence on human dignity in the face of segregation, racism, and
7 Jim Crow laws sparked the city-wide bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, that brought an
8 unknown young minister, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to national prominence; and
9 WHEREAS, alongside Dr. King, Rosa Parks became a leader and an icon in the national
10 effort that resulted in the United States Supreme Court decision outlawing the segregation
11 of city buses and gave critical momentum to the larger battle for civil rights; and
12 WHEREAS, Rosa Parks has been hailed as the "Mother of the Civil Rights Movement" in
13 America for her pivotal act on that day in Alabama, as well as for her lifelong commitment
14 to justice for Black Americans; and

15 WHEREAS, Rosa Parks received the Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize, the
16 Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a Congressional Gold Medal; and following her death
17 at age 92, she became the first woman to lie in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda;
18 and
19 WHEREAS, this historic stronghold created a wave of positive change in America, which
20 is evident by women being allowed to serve on submarines in the United States armed forces
21 and taking leadership positions in religious, business, and political arenas; more women
22 serving in Congress than ever before; the first woman, Kamala Harris, being elected to serve
23 as Vice President of the United States; and the election of the nation's first Black president;
24 and
25 WHEREAS, Rosa Parks risked her life on December 1, 1955, in a selfless effort to end
26 racism, it is abundantly fitting and proper that her legacy is honored and the fight for equal
27 rights and the ending of racism continues.
28 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
29 honor the memory of Mrs. Rosa Parks and her gallant service to this nation and the Civil
30 Rights Movement and recognize February 4, 2025, as Rosa Parks Day at the state capitol.
31 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
32 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and the
