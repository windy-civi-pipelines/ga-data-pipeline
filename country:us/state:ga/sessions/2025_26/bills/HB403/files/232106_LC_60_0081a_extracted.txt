306 holder or other person and his or her successors, successors-in-title, and assigns."
307 SECTION 7.
308 Said title is further amended by revising Code Section 44-3-232, relating to assessments

344 writing, the lien may be foreclosed by the association by an action, judgment, and court
345 order for foreclosure in the same manner as other liens for the improvement of real
346 property, subject to superior liens or encumbrances, but any such court order for judicial
347 foreclosure shall not affect the rights of holders of superior liens or encumbrances to
348 exercise any rights or powers afforded to them under their security instruments. The notice
349 provided for in this subsection shall specify the amount of the assessments then due and
350 payable together with authorized late charges and the rate of interest accruing thereon. No

368 assessments created by this Code section to be extinguished and of no further force or
369 effect as to the title or interest acquired by the purchaser or lender, if any, as the case may
370 be, and their respective successors and assigns, in the transaction contemplated in
371 connection with such request. The information specified in such statement shall be binding
