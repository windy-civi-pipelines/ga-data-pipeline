H. B. 816
- 8 -
25 LC 62 0159/AP
183 revenue bonds or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such revenue bonds
184 shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this
185 section. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, this Act shall not affect the ability of the
186 authority and any political subdivision to enter into an intergovernmental contract pursuant
187 to which the political subdivision agrees to pay amounts sufficient to pay operating charges
188 and other costs of the authority or any project including, without limitation, the principal of
189 and interest on revenue bonds in consideration for services or facilities of the authority.
190 SECTION 10.
191 Trust indenture as security.
192 In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust
193 indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust
194 company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without this state. Either
195 the resolution providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds or such trust indenture may
196 contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the
197 bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including
198 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition and
199 construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project,
200 and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all money.
201 SECTION 11.

H. B. 816
- 9 -

206 mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights it may have under
207 the laws of the state, including specifically, but without limitation, the Revenue Bond Law,
208 or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel
209 performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be
210 performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and
211 collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the facilities and
212 services furnished.
213 SECTION 12.
214 Trust indenture as security; validation.
215 Revenue bonds and the security therefor shall be issued, confirmed, and validated in
216 accordance with the provisions of the Revenue Bond Law. The petition for validation shall
217 also make any political subdivision of the state party defendant to such action if the political
218 subdivision has contracted with the authority for services or facilities relating to the project
219 for which revenue bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such defendant shall
220 be required to show cause, if any exists, as to why such contract or contracts shall not be
221 adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such revenue bonds.
222 The revenue bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and
223 conclusive with respect to such revenue bonds and the security for the payment thereof and
224 interest thereon and against the authority and all other defendants.
225 SECTION 13.
226 To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid.
227 In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the
228 authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue bonds to
H. B. 816
- 10 -

230 of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such
231 regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.
232 SECTION 14.
233 Venue and jurisdiction.
234 Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or
235 action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Greene County, and
236 any action pertaining to validation of any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this
237 Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction
238 of such actions.
239 SECTION 15.
240 Interest of bondholders protected.
241 While any of the revenue bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers
242 duties, or existence of such authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be
243 diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the
244 holders of such revenue bonds; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority shall
245 be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the
246 interests and rights of the holders of such revenue bonds, nor shall the state itself so compete
247 with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the
248 holders of any such revenue bonds, and upon the issuance of such revenue bonds under the
249 provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such revenue bonds.

- 8 -

25 LC 62 0159/AP
183 revenue bonds or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such revenue bonds

197 bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including
198 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition and
199 construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project,

208 or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel
209 performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be

215 Revenue bonds and the security therefor shall be issued, confirmed, and validated in
216 accordance with the provisions of the Revenue Bond Law. The petition for validation shall
217 also make any political subdivision of the state party defendant to such action if the political
218 subdivision has contracted with the authority for services or facilities relating to the project
219 for which revenue bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such defendant shall
220 be required to show cause, if any exists, as to why such contract or contracts shall not be
221 adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such revenue bonds.
222 The revenue bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and
223 conclusive with respect to such revenue bonds and the security for the payment thereof and
224 interest thereon and against the authority and all other defendants.
225 SECTION 13.
226 To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid.
227 In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the

231 regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.
232 SECTION 14.
233 Venue and jurisdiction.

237 Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction
238 of such actions.
239 SECTION 15.
240 Interest of bondholders protected.
241 While any of the revenue bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers
242 duties, or existence of such authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be
243 diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the
244 holders of such revenue bonds; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority shall
245 be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the
246 interests and rights of the holders of such revenue bonds, nor shall the state itself so compete
247 with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the
248 holders of any such revenue bonds, and upon the issuance of such revenue bonds under the
249 provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such revenue bonds.
