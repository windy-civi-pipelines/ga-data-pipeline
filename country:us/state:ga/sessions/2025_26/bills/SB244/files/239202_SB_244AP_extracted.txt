138 response in opposition to the claim and appear at the hearing for the purpose of contesting

140 (c) At a hearing held pursuant to subsection (b) of this Code section on a claim filed under
141 this chapter, the claimant, the Attorney General, or the prosecuting district attorney may
142 present evidence in support of or in opposition to the claimant's eligibility for compensation
143 under this chapter or regarding the amount of compensation that the claimant is entitled to

151 such compensation to be awarded. Within 30 days after the administrative law judge has

157 a jury, shall be confined to the record, and nothing in this chapter shall preclude the appeal
158 of any decision or order issued by such superior court during or upon the completion of its
159 review of the decision issued by the administrative law judge. If no such appeal of the
160 administrative law judge's decision is timely filed, such decision shall become final and the
161 administrative law judge shall, subject to the limitation provided in subsection (e) of this
162 Code section, issue a judgment either awarding compensation to the claimant or denying
163 the claim. If such an appeal of the administrative law judge's decision is filed, the
164 administrative law judge shall only issue a judgment when such appeal process is
S. B. 244
- 7 -

166 judgment after completion of such appeal process shall be subject to the limitation provided
167 in subsection (e) of this Code section.
168 (e) No claimant shall be entitled to compensation under this chapter, and no judgment

177 against the state, any state governmental entity, or any current or former members, officers,
178 employees, or agents of the state or any state governmental entity that arise out of or relate
179 to any and all facts in connection with the claimant's wrongful conviction and
180 incarceration. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a claimant to release
181 any claims, demands, actions, causes of action, or damages that the claimant may have or
182 claim to have against any political subdivision of this state or any current or former
183 members, officers, employees, or agents of any political subdivision of this state.

198 served for the charge for which the claimant is making a claim under this chapter,
199 consistent with the requirements of Code Section 17-10-11; provided, however, that a
200 claimant shall not be entitled to compensation under this chapter for any portion of a
201 sentence spent incarcerated during which the claimant was also serving a concurrent
202 sentence of incarceration for another crime for which the claimant's conviction was not
203 overturned and for which the claimant was not pardoned based on innocence, except to the
204 extent that:
205 (1) The sentence for that crime was longer than it would have been without consideration
206 by the sentencing court of one or more of the crimes at issue; or
207 (2) The intact conviction was based on an Alford plea or a plea of nolo contendere

211 in the Alford plea or the plea of nolo contendere.
212 (c) If a claimant has received a monetary award or settlement in a civil action against the
213 state, any state governmental entity, or any member, officer, employee, or agent of the state

215 conviction and incarceration, such amount received by the claimant, less any attorney's
S. B. 244
- 9 -

216 fees, costs, and expenses paid by the claimant in obtaining the civil action award or
217 settlement, shall be deducted from the amount of the compensation award to which the
218 claimant is entitled under subsection (a) of this Code section.
219 (d) Beginning on January 1, 2026, and each year thereafter, the Office of State
220 Administrative Hearings, by rules and regulations, shall adjust the dollar amounts specified
221 in subsection (a) of this Code section to reflect the effect of annual inflation or deflation
222 on the cost of living that citizens of this state experienced in the prior calendar year. In
223 making such adjustments, the Office of State Administrative Hearings may use the
224 Consumer Price Index, or its successor or appropriate replacement index, if any, published
225 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.
226 17-22-8.

236 17-22-9.
237 (a) There is created the Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration Compensation Trust Fund
238 as a separate fund in the state treasury. The state treasurer shall credit to the trust fund all
239 moneys appropriated by the General Assembly for the purpose of providing claimants with
240 compensation under this chapter and shall invest the moneys held in the trust fund in the
S. B. 244
- 10 -
25 LC 55 0633S
241 same manner in which state funds are invested as authorized by the State Depository Board
242 pursuant to Article 3 of Chapter 17 of Title 50.
243 (b) No award of compensation issued under this chapter shall be payable except from the
244 Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration Compensation Trust Fund. Nothing in this chapter
245 shall be construed to authorize any execution or levy against any state property or state
246 funds, and such execution or levy against any state property or state funds for purposes of
247 paying compensation awards issued under this chapter is expressly prohibited. The liability
248 of the state under this chapter shall never exceed the amount of funds available in the
249 Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration Compensation Trust Fund and no award of
250 compensation issued under this chapter shall be payable unless and until the General
251 Assembly appropriates moneys for the payment thereof.
252 (c) Subject to the availability of funds, any award of compensation issued under this
253 chapter shall be paid out of the Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration Compensation
254 Trust Fund as follows:

260 amount.
261 (B) If the judgment awarding such compensation is issued by the administrative law
262 judge pursuant to subsection (d) of Code Section 17-22-6 on or after September 1 of a
263 given calendar year, the state treasurer shall pay to the claimant an initial sum of
264 $18,000.00 within 60 days of such judgment being issued and such judgment being
265 presented to the state treasurer for payment, and such initial sum shall be deducted from
266 the total award amount.
S. B. 244
- 11 -

267 (2) Thereafter, the General Assembly shall, through an amended appropriations Act for
268 the current fiscal year for a judgment issued before September 1 of a given calendar year
269 or through the general appropriations Act for the next fiscal year for a judgment issued
270 on or after September 1 of a given calendar year, appropriate a sum sufficient to pay the
271 remainder of the award of compensation; provided, however, that, for any award of
272 compensation that exceeds $1.5 million, the General Assembly shall appropriate such
273 sum in equal amounts over three separate fiscal years. Within 60 days of such
274 appropriation being made and such funds being credited to the Wrongful Conviction and
275 Incarceration Compensation Trust Fund, the state treasurer shall pay to the claimant the
276 remainder of the award of compensation; provided, however, that, if such award exceeds
277 $1.5 million, the state treasurer shall pay to the claimant the remainder of the award in
278 three equal payments, each within 60 days of such amounts being appropriated by the
279 General Assembly and credited to the Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration
280 Compensation Trust Fund.
281 (d) Any payment of an award of compensation pursuant to subsection (c) of this Code
282 section may be made to or for the benefit of the claimant, or, in the case of the death of the
283 claimant, to or for the benefit of one or more heirs at law or designated beneficiaries of the
284 claimant.
285 17-22-10.
286 Subject to the provisions and limitations of this chapter, the sovereign immunity of this
287 state is waived for the purpose of authorizing claimants to file claims for and seek
288 compensation awards under this chapter and for authorizing payment of any judgment
289 awarding such compensation from the Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration
290 Compensation Trust Fund.

295 this chapter.
296 17-22-12.
297 (a) A court entering a dismissal or judgment of acquittal after a defendant's criminal
298 conviction has been overturned, vacated, or reversed shall provide a copy of this chapter
299 to the defendant at the time of entry of the dismissal or acquittal and obtain from the
300 defendant a written acknowledgment of receipt of a copy of this chapter on a form

25 LC 55 0633S
113 (b) In evaluating whether a claimant has met the requirements of subsection (a) of this

117 claimant or those acting on the claimant's behalf.
118 (c) Upon determining that a claimant meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this Code
119 section, an administrative law judge shall award compensation to the claimant for wrongful

25 LC 55 0633S
138 response in opposition to the claim and appear at the hearing for the purpose of contesting
139 the claim.
140 (c) At a hearing held pursuant to subsection (b) of this Code section on a claim filed under
141 this chapter, the claimant, the Attorney General, or the prosecuting district attorney may
142 present evidence in support of or in opposition to the claimant's eligibility for compensation
143 under this chapter or regarding the amount of compensation that the claimant is entitled to
144 pursuant to Code Section 17-22-7. The rules of evidence established in Code Section

146 (d) Within 30 days of holding a hearing under subsection (b) of this Code section, the

150 judge's findings and an explanation of the administrative law judge's calculation of any
151 such compensation to be awarded. Within 30 days after the administrative law judge has

153 attorney may appeal such decision by filing, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
154 3 of Title 5, a petition for review in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior

157 a jury, shall be confined to the record, and nothing in this chapter shall preclude the appeal
158 of any decision or order issued by such superior court during or upon the completion of its
159 review of the decision issued by the administrative law judge. If no such appeal of the
160 administrative law judge's decision is timely filed, such decision shall become final and the
161 administrative law judge shall, subject to the limitation provided in subsection (e) of this
162 Code section, issue a judgment either awarding compensation to the claimant or denying
163 the claim. If such an appeal of the administrative law judge's decision is filed, the
164 administrative law judge shall only issue a judgment when such appeal process is
S. B. 244

166 judgment after completion of such appeal process shall be subject to the limitation provided
167 in subsection (e) of this Code section.
168 (e) No claimant shall be entitled to compensation under this chapter, and no judgment

177 against the state, any state governmental entity, or any current or former members, officers,
178 employees, or agents of the state or any state governmental entity that arise out of or relate
179 to any and all facts in connection with the claimant's wrongful conviction and
180 incarceration. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a claimant to release
181 any claims, demands, actions, causes of action, or damages that the claimant may have or
182 claim to have against any political subdivision of this state or any current or former
183 members, officers, employees, or agents of any political subdivision of this state.

198 served for the charge for which the claimant is making a claim under this chapter,
199 consistent with the requirements of Code Section 17-10-11; provided, however, that a
200 claimant shall not be entitled to compensation under this chapter for any portion of a
201 sentence spent incarcerated during which the claimant was also serving a concurrent
202 sentence of incarceration for another crime for which the claimant's conviction was not
203 overturned and for which the claimant was not pardoned based on innocence, except to the
204 extent that:
205 (1) The sentence for that crime was longer than it would have been without consideration
206 by the sentencing court of one or more of the crimes at issue; or
207 (2) The intact conviction was based on an Alford plea or a plea of nolo contendere
208 maintaining a claim of innocence that the claimant accepted to resolve the underlying
209 case after the original conviction was overturned, and the claimant proves by a
210 preponderance of the evidence that the claimant did not commit the crime that resulted
211 in the Alford plea or the plea of nolo contendere.
212 (c) If a claimant has received a monetary award or settlement in a civil action against the
213 state, any state governmental entity, or any member, officer, employee, or agent of the state
214 or a state governmental agency arising from or relating to the claimant's wrongful
215 conviction and incarceration, such amount received by the claimant, less any attorney's
S. B. 244
- 9 -

25 LC 55 0633S
216 fees, costs, and expenses paid by the claimant in obtaining the civil action award or
217 settlement, shall be deducted from the amount of the compensation award to which the
218 claimant is entitled under subsection (a) of this Code section.
219 (d) Beginning on January 1, 2026, and each year thereafter, the Office of State
220 Administrative Hearings, by rules and regulations, shall adjust the dollar amounts specified
221 in subsection (a) of this Code section to reflect the effect of annual inflation or deflation
222 on the cost of living that citizens of this state experienced in the prior calendar year. In
223 making such adjustments, the Office of State Administrative Hearings may use the
224 Consumer Price Index, or its successor or appropriate replacement index, if any, published
225 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.
226 17-22-8.

236 17-22-9.
237 (a) There is created the Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration Compensation Trust Fund
238 as a separate fund in the state treasury. The state treasurer shall credit to the trust fund all
239 moneys appropriated by the General Assembly for the purpose of providing claimants with
240 compensation under this chapter and shall invest the moneys held in the trust fund in the
S. B. 244
- 10 -

25 LC 55 0633S
241 same manner in which state funds are invested as authorized by the State Depository Board
242 pursuant to Article 3 of Chapter 17 of Title 50.
243 (b) No award of compensation issued under this chapter shall be payable except from the
244 Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration Compensation Trust Fund. Nothing in this chapter
245 shall be construed to authorize any execution or levy against any state property or state
246 funds, and such execution or levy against any state property or state funds for purposes of
247 paying compensation awards issued under this chapter is expressly prohibited. The liability
248 of the state under this chapter shall never exceed the amount of funds available in the
249 Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration Compensation Trust Fund and no award of
250 compensation issued under this chapter shall be payable unless and until the General
251 Assembly appropriates moneys for the payment thereof.
252 (c) Subject to the availability of funds, any award of compensation issued under this
253 chapter shall be paid out of the Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration Compensation
254 Trust Fund as follows:
255 (1)(A) If the judgment awarding such compensation is issued by the administrative law

260 amount.
261 (B) If the judgment awarding such compensation is issued by the administrative law
262 judge pursuant to subsection (d) of Code Section 17-22-6 on or after September 1 of a
263 given calendar year, the state treasurer shall pay to the claimant an initial sum of
264 $18,000.00 within 60 days of such judgment being issued and such judgment being
265 presented to the state treasurer for payment, and such initial sum shall be deducted from
266 the total award amount.
S. B. 244

25 LC 55 0633S
267 (2) Thereafter, the General Assembly shall, through an amended appropriations Act for
268 the current fiscal year for a judgment issued before September 1 of a given calendar year
269 or through the general appropriations Act for the next fiscal year for a judgment issued
270 on or after September 1 of a given calendar year, appropriate a sum sufficient to pay the
271 remainder of the award of compensation; provided, however, that, for any award of
272 compensation that exceeds $1.5 million, the General Assembly shall appropriate such
273 sum in equal amounts over three separate fiscal years. Within 60 days of such
274 appropriation being made and such funds being credited to the Wrongful Conviction and
275 Incarceration Compensation Trust Fund, the state treasurer shall pay to the claimant the
276 remainder of the award of compensation; provided, however, that, if such award exceeds
277 $1.5 million, the state treasurer shall pay to the claimant the remainder of the award in
278 three equal payments, each within 60 days of such amounts being appropriated by the
279 General Assembly and credited to the Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration
280 Compensation Trust Fund.
281 (d) Any payment of an award of compensation pursuant to subsection (c) of this Code
282 section may be made to or for the benefit of the claimant, or, in the case of the death of the
283 claimant, to or for the benefit of one or more heirs at law or designated beneficiaries of the
284 claimant.
285 17-22-10.
286 Subject to the provisions and limitations of this chapter, the sovereign immunity of this
287 state is waived for the purpose of authorizing claimants to file claims for and seek
288 compensation awards under this chapter and for authorizing payment of any judgment
289 awarding such compensation from the Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration
290 Compensation Trust Fund.
