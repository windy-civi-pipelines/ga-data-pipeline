47 petition. Petition signatures must be collected within the boundaries of at least one-half of
48 the state's congressional districts for the petition to be certified.
49 (b) The petition for a direct initiative or referendum proposing a statute, amendment to
50 a statute, or repeal of a statute shall state the full text of the statute or amendment to be
51 enacted or repealed and shall contain the following enacting clause: 'BE IT ENACTED BY
52 THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA:'. No statute or section of the Official

61 petition is certified; provided, however, that such ballot questions shall be unambiguous
62 and understandable for the voters and subject to a yes or no vote.
63 (c) A direct initiative or referendum petition shall be filed with the Secretary of State not
64 less than 180 days before a general election in which members of the General Assembly
65 are to be elected. The Secretary of State shall immediately proceed to examine the filed
66 petition and compute and verify whether or not a sufficient number of signatures are

67 captured. If the petition contains less than the required number of signatures, the Secretary
68 of State shall reject the petition; provided, however, that the General Assembly by law may
69 provide for a period to cure such deficiencies. If the petition appears to contain the
70 required number of signatures, the Secretary of State shall certify the petition, and shall put
71 the direct initiative or referendum on the ballot at the next general election at which
72 members of the General Assembly are to be elected, using the ballot question outlined in
73 the petition.
74 (d) If such ballot question is approved by at least 60 percent of the electors qualified to

77 following such election, unless an earlier effective date is provided for in the direct
78 initiative or referendum and is clearly stated in the ballot question.
79 (e) If such ballot question is rejected by the electors voting in such general election, such
80 proposal shall not become law, and the same or a substantially similar proposal by direct
