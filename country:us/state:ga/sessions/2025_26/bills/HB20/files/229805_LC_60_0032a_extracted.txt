17 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
18 SECTION 1.
19 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Student Mental Health and Suicide
20 Prevention Act."
21 SECTION 2.
22 The General Assembly finds that:
23 (1) Depression is the most common mental health disorder among American teenagers and
24 adults. In 2021, over 5 million young people between the ages of 12 and 17 experienced
25 at least one major depressive episode in the prior year. Major depressive episodes are two
26 to three times more common in females than in males;
27 (2) Various biological, psychological, and environmental risk factors may contribute to
28 teenage depression, which can lead to substance and alcohol abuse, social isolation, poor
29 academic and workplace performance, unnecessary risk taking, early pregnancy, and
30 suicide, which is the third leading cause of death among teenagers. Approximately 20
31 percent of teenagers with depression seriously consider suicide and one in 12 attempt
32 suicide. Untreated teenage depression can also result in adverse consequences into and
33 throughout adulthood;
34 (3) Most teenagers who experience depression suffer from more than one episode. It is
35 estimated that although teenage depression is highly treatable through combinations of
36 therapy, individual and group counseling, and certain medications, fewer than one-third of
37 teenagers experiencing depression seek help or treatment; and
38 (4) The proper detection and diagnosis of depression is key in reducing the risk of teenage
39 suicide and improving physical and mental health outcomes for young people. It is
40 therefore fitting and appropriate to establish school based depression screenings to help
41 identify the symptoms of depression and facilitate access to appropriate treatment.

17 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
18 SECTION 1.
19 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Student Mental Health and Suicide
20 Prevention Act."
21 SECTION 2.
22 The General Assembly finds that:
23 (1) Depression is the most common mental health disorder among American teenagers and
24 adults. In 2021, over 5 million young people between the ages of 12 and 17 experienced
25 at least one major depressive episode in the prior year. Major depressive episodes are two
26 to three times more common in females than in males;
27 (2) Various biological, psychological, and environmental risk factors may contribute to
28 teenage depression, which can lead to substance and alcohol abuse, social isolation, poor
29 academic and workplace performance, unnecessary risk taking, early pregnancy, and
30 suicide, which is the third leading cause of death among teenagers. Approximately 20
31 percent of teenagers with depression seriously consider suicide and one in 12 attempt
32 suicide. Untreated teenage depression can also result in adverse consequences into and
33 throughout adulthood;
34 (3) Most teenagers who experience depression suffer from more than one episode. It is
35 estimated that although teenage depression is highly treatable through combinations of
36 therapy, individual and group counseling, and certain medications, fewer than one-third of
37 teenagers experiencing depression seek help or treatment; and
38 (4) The proper detection and diagnosis of depression is key in reducing the risk of teenage
39 suicide and improving physical and mental health outcomes for young people. It is
40 therefore fitting and appropriate to establish school based depression screenings to help
41 identify the symptoms of depression and facilitate access to appropriate treatment.
