71 provided in subsection (c) of this section, it shall not be necessary to make application

84 in addition to any other base year value homestead exemption provided by law with respect
85 to the City of Cartersville independent school district. In any such event, the Bartow
86 County tax commissioner shall apply only the base year value homestead exemption that
87 is larger or more beneficial for the taxpayer with respect to the City of Cartersville
88 independent school district.
89 (f) For the purposes of this section, the Bartow County tax commissioner shall promulgate
90 a standardized method for determining annual inflationary index rates which reflect the
91 effects of inflation and deflation on the cost of living for residents of Bartow County for a
92 given calendar year. Such method may utilize the Consumer Price Index as reported by the
93 Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor or any other similar
94 index established by the federal government if the Bartow County tax commissioner
95 determines that such federal index fairly reflects the effects of inflation and deflation on
96 residents of the City of Cartersville independent school district.
