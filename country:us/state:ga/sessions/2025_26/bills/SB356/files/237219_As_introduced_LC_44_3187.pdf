15 (a) As used in this Act, the term:
16 (1) "Ad valorem taxes for educational purposes" means all ad valorem taxes for
17 educational purposes levied by, for, or on behalf of the Polk County school district,
18 including, but not limited to, any ad valorem taxes to pay interest on and to retire county

22 (b)(1) Each resident of the Polk County school district who is at least 65 years of age but
23 not yet 70 years of age on January 1 of the year in which application for the exemption
24 is made is granted an exemption on that person's homestead from Polk County school
25 district ad valorem taxes for educational purposes in the amount of the greater of 50

40 (4) In calendar year 2026, the maximum amount of homestead exemptions granted under
41 this Act shall not exceed $150 million in the aggregate annually. Upon the closing of the
42 books for the filing of homestead exemptions for such taxable year, the Polk County
43 governing authority or its designee shall calculate the aggregate amount of homestead
44 exemptions claimed under this Act for such taxable year. If such total is equal to or less
45 than $150 million in the aggregate for that taxable year, then each senior citizen claiming
46 a homestead exemption under this Act shall receive the full value of such exemption. If
47 the total exceeds $150 million in the aggregate for that taxable year, the governing
48 authority or its designee shall calculate the amount by which the total exceeds $150
49 million and shall reduce the amount of homestead exemptions claimed by such senior
50 citizens in an amount equal to such difference so that the total amount of homestead
51 exemptions being claimed under this Act for such taxable year shall equal $150 million.
52 Such reduction shall be applied on proportionate basis.
53 (c) A person shall not receive any homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this
54 section unless such person or person's agent files an application with the tax commissioner
55 of Polk County, giving such person's age and such additional information relative to
56 receiving such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner of Polk County to make a
57 determination regarding the initial and continuing eligibility of such person for such
58 exemption. The tax commissioner of Polk County shall provide application forms for this
59 purpose.
60 (d) The exemptions shall be claimed and returned as provided in Code Section 48-5-50.1 of
61 the O.C.G.A., as amended. The exemptions shall be automatically renewed from year to year
62 so long as the person granted a homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this section
63 occupies the residence as a homestead. After such person has filed the proper application as
64 provided in subsection (c) of this section, it shall not be necessary to make application
65 thereafter for any year, and such exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It
66 shall be the duty of any such person granted a homestead exemption under subsection (b) of
S. B. 356

70 state ad valorem taxes, county ad valorem taxes for county purposes, municipal ad valorem
71 taxes for municipal purposes, or independent school district ad valorem taxes for educational
72 purposes. The homestead exemptions granted by subsection (b) of this section shall be in
73 addition to and not in lieu of any other homestead exemption applicable to Polk County
74 school district ad valorem taxes for educational purposes.
75 SECTION 2.
76 In accordance with the requirements of Article VII, Section II of the Constitution of the State
77 of Georgia, this Act shall not become law unless it receives the requisite two-thirds' majority

102 as provided in this section, Section 1 of this Act shall not become effective, and this Act shall
103 be automatically repealed on the 365th calendar day following the election date provided for

105 election superintendent's duty to certify the result thereof to the Secretary of State. The
106 provisions of this section shall be mandatory upon the election superintendent and are not
107 intended as directory. If the election superintendent fails or refuses to comply with this
108 section, any elector of the Polk County school district may apply for a writ of mandamus to
109 compel the election superintendent to perform his or her duties under this section. If the
110 court finds that the election superintendent has not complied with this section, the court shall
111 fashion appropriate relief requiring the election superintendent to call and conduct such
112 election on the date required by this section or on the next date authorized for special
113 elections provided for in Code Section 21-2-540 of the O.C.G.A.
114 SECTION 4.
