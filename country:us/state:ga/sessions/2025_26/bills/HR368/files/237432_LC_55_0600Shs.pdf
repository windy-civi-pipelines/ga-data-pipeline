The House Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs offers the following
substitute to HR 368:
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the House Study Committee on Intoxicating Cannabinoids in Consumable Hemp
2 Products; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, in 2018, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Agriculture
4 Improvement Act of 2018, Public Law 115-334 (2018 Farm Bill), which authorized the
5 production of hemp and removed hemp from the federal schedule of controlled substances;
6 and
7 WHEREAS, through the Georgia Hemp Farming Act, approved May 10, 2019 (Ga. L. 2019,
8 p. 1030), the General Assembly authorized the production of hemp in Georgia in accordance
9 with the federal 2018 Farm Bill; and
10 WHEREAS, the definition of hemp in the federal 2018 Farm Bill and the Georgia Hemp
11 Farming Act limits the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) that may be
12 present in hemp, but neither Act provides limits on other isomers of delta-9-THC or other
13 cannabinoids; and
14 WHEREAS, by an Act of the General Assembly, approved April 30, 2024 (Ga. L. 2024, p.
15 455), the General Assembly provided regulations on the production and sale of consumable

16 hemp products, but did not provide restrictions on isomers of delta-9-THC or other
17 potentially intoxicating cannabinoids; and
18 WHEREAS, since passage of the 2018 Farm Bill and the Georgia Hemp Farming Act, it has
19 been discovered that many other substances derived from the cannabis plant beyond
20 delta-9-THC may be intoxicating and may have serious side effects. Such substances
21 include, but are not limited to, delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC),
22 delta-10-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-10-THC), delta-11-tetrahydrocannabinol
23 (delta-11-THC), tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), exo-tetrahydrocannabinol (exo-THC),
24 THC-O-acetate (THC-OA), THC-O-phosphate (THC-O), tetrahydrocannabiphorol (THCP),
25 tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), tetrahydrocannabihexol (THCH), tetrahydrocannabioctyl
26 (THCJD), tetrahydrocannabutol (THCB), cannabinol (CBN), and hexahydrocannabinol
27 (HHC); and
28 WHEREAS, the lack of restrictions on such substances have led to intoxicating and
29 potentially dangerous consumable hemp products being readily available in Georgia and
30 consumed at alarming rates; and
31 WHEREAS, the General Assembly intends to provide restrictions on such substances and
32 other intoxicating cannabinoids so as to protect the citizens of this state from such
33 intoxicating and potentially dangerous substances. However, the General Assembly desires
34 to provide those in the consumable hemp industry, government agencies, law enforcement
35 officers, and members of the public the opportunity to provide comment on such potential
36 restrictions before they are enacted so as to understand the need for such restrictions, how
37 such restrictions should be implemented, and the impact such restrictions may have on the
38 hemp industry in Georgia; and

42 products in this state; and

44 consumable hemp products in this state, particularly on the sale of consumable hemp
45 beverages.
