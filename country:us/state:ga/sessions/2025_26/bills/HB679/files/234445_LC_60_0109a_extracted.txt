A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Chapter 8 of Title 13 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to illegal
2 and void contracts generally, so as to prohibit certain agreements involving rental
3 price-fixing as unenforceable contracts in general restraint of trade with respect to residential
4 rental properties; to provide for a criminal penalty; to provide for statutory construction; to
5 provide for a short title; to provide for an effective date and applicability; to provide for
6 related matters; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.
7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
8 SECTION 1.
9 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "End Rental Price-Fixing Act."
10 SECTION 2.
11 The General Assembly finds that there is a housing crisis in Georgia. For many years, the
12 cost of living in Georgia has been low, providing benefits to existing Georgians and
13 encouraging future residents to move to Georgia. However, the cost of housing in Georgia
14 has begun to rise steeply. One factor in this recent increase is coordination among landlords
15 to fix rental prices. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice sued a Georgia landlord over

17 the financial well-being of Georgians. The General Assembly finds, therefore, that this Act
18 is necessary to protect the general welfare of Georgians.
