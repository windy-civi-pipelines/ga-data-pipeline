443 force and effect of law in the member states.
444 (c) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a

480 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to

482 service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this
483 compact, or promulgated rules.
484 (b) Default, technical assistance, and termination:

495 states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may
496 be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
497 the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
498 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means
499 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall

444 (c) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a

480 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to

483 compact, or promulgated rules.
484 (b) Default, technical assistance, and termination:

495 states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may
496 be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
497 the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
498 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means
499 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall
500 be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
501 defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority and each of the
502 member states' licensing authorities.

525 against a member state in default in the United States District Court for the District of
526 Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce
527 compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief
528 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
529 is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
530 reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
531 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or
532 the defaulting member state's law.

580 nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.

585 (a) This compact and the commission's rule making authority shall be liberally construed
586 so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of the compact.
587 Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules
588 shall not be construed to limit the commission's rule making authority solely for those
589 purposes.
590 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence
591 or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
592 the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the
593 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
594 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
595 of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
596 agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
597 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the commission may deny a state's
598 participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of
599 Section 10, terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if it determines that
600 a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact.
601 Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member
602 state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states
603 and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
604 SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
