16 (2) School administration to notify local emergency first responders of an active threat
17 to safety upon a school campus; and
18 (3) A public elementary or secondary school to communicate with neighboring local
19 school systems about threats made on or impacting a school campus or emergency
20 procedures initiated upon a school campus due to an active threat to safety.
21 (b) No later than July 1, 2027, the State Board of Education shall establish a secure
22 state-wide database for use by public elementary and secondary schools in this state to
23 report and monitor incidents of safety threats made on or impacting a school campus. The
24 name of any person who threatens the safety of a school shall be included in such database;
25 provided, however, that no student shall be entered on any such database until the threat
26 to school safety has been investigated and verified by local law enforcement and the
27 student has been evaluated by a certificated school social worker from the local school
28 system, if any are employed by the school system. The State Board of Education shall
29 develop standards for determining when a verified threat qualifies for inclusion of a person
30 within the database and a method for petitioning for removal from any database developed
31 pursuant to this subsection. Any such removal standards shall include a required
32 evaluation of the student by a certified school social worker. Such database shall be
33 accessible only to designated personnel at each public elementary or secondary school in
34 this state. When a student has been added to the database established pursuant to this
35 subsection, the local school system shall provide the parents or guardians of the student
36 with recommendations for counseling services and provide the student with available
37 specialized mental health services while in school.
38 (c) The State Board of Education shall be authorized to consult with the Georgia
39 Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, the Georgia Bureau of
40 Investigation, and local boards of education and other elementary and secondary school
41 governing bodies for purposes of this Code section."
