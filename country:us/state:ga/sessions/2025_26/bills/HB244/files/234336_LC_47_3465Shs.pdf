H. B. 244 (SUB)
- 6 -

25 LC 47 3465S
150 (A) A period of 90 days following a 180 day waiver granted pursuant to paragraph (4)
151 of subsection (d) of this Code section; or
152 (B) In the event that a 180 day waiver granted pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection
153 (d) of this Code section was granted to such county or consolidated government in the
154 previous two years, a period of 90 days following the deadline provided for in
155 paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of this Code section.
156 The waiver provided for in this paragraph shall only be granted if the county or
157 consolidated government's failure to timely file an audit is the result of the failure of one
158 or more such officers to cooperate or provide documentation as required by this
159 paragraph.
160 (3) In the event that a county or consolidated government fails to forward a copy of an
161 audit or report to the state auditor within the time frame provided for in this Code section,
162 and such failure is the result of the failure of a county officer listed in Article IX,
163 Section I, Paragraph III(a) of the Constitution, other than judges of the probate court, to
164 cooperate with such county or consolidated government in the preparation of such audit
165 or report, the governing authority of such county or consolidated government,
166 notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, shall temporarily withhold 50
167 percent of the compensation paid to such officer from county funds until such time as
168 such officer has provided all cooperation and information necessary for the filing of the
169 audit or report. Within 14 days of such an audit or report being completed and forwarded
170 to the state auditor, the governing authority of the county or consolidated government
171 shall pay all such withheld compensation to the officer; provided, however, that such
172 officer shall not be entitled to receive any interest or additional compensation related to
173 such withheld funds.
174 (e) A copy of the report and of any comments made by the state auditor pursuant to
175 paragraph (2) of subsection (d) of this Code section shall be maintained as a public record
176 for public inspection during the regular working hours at the principal office of the local
H. B. 244 (SUB)
- 7 -

25 LC 47 3465S
177 government. Those units of local government not having a principal office shall provide
178 a notification to the public as to the location of and times during which the public may
179 inspect the report.
180 (f) Upon a failure, refusal, or neglect to have an annual audit made, or a failure to file a
181 copy of the annual audit report with the state auditor, or a failure to correct auditing
182 deficiencies noted by the state auditor, the state auditor shall cause a prominent notice to
183 be published in the legal organ of, and any other newspapers of general circulation within,
184 the unit of local government. Such notice shall be a prominently displayed advertisement
185 or news article and shall not be placed in that section of the newspaper where legal notices
186 appear. Such notice shall be published twice and shall state that the governing authority
187 of the unit of local government has failed or refused, as the case may be, to file an audit
188 report or to correct auditing deficiencies, as the case may be, for the fiscal year or years in
189 question. Such notice shall further state that such failure or refusal is in violation of state
190 law.
191 (g) The state auditor may waive the requirement of correction of auditing deficiencies for
192 a period of one year from the required audit filing date, provided evidence is presented that
193 substantial progress is being made towards toward removing the cause of the need for the
194 waiver. No such waiver for the same set of deficiencies shall be granted for more than two
195 successive years to the same local government."
196 SECTION 2.
197 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
