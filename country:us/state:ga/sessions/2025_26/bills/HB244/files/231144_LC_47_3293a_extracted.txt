17 on prior findings. If corrective action is not necessary, the written comments should
18 include a statement describing the reason it is not. In the case of units provided for in
19 paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section, the audit reports for both fiscal
20 periods shall be submitted within 180 days after the close of each second fiscal year and
21 the written comments shall be submitted within 30 days after the audit report due date.
22 (2) The state auditor shall review the audit report and written comments submitted to the

24 If the state auditor finds the requirements for audits of local governments have not been
25 complied with, the state auditor shall within 60 days of receipt of the audit or the written
26 comments notify the governing authority and the auditor who performed the audit and
27 shall submit to them a list of deficiencies to be corrected. A copy of this notification shall
28 also be sent by the state auditor to each member of the General Assembly whose
29 senatorial or representative district includes any part of the unit of local government.
30 (3) If the state auditor has not received any required audit or written comments by the
31 date specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the state auditor shall within 30 days
32 of such date notify the unit of local government that the audit has not been received as
33 required by law. A copy of this notification shall also be sent by the state auditor to each
34 member of the General Assembly whose senatorial or representative district includes any
35 part of the unit of local government.
36 (4) The state auditor, for good cause shown by those local units in which an audit is in
37 the process of being conducted or will promptly be conducted, may waive the
38 requirement for completion of the audit within 180 days. Such waiver shall be for an
39 additional period of not more than 180 days and no such waiver shall be granted for more
40 than two successive years to the same unit of local government.
41 (4.1) If the state auditor receives, prior to the audit report due date provided for in

44 date through no fault of such local government, the state auditor shall extend such audit
45 report due date by 90 days. The provisions of paragraph (5) of this subsection shall not
46 become applicable to a local government during the extension period allowed under this

49 paragraph (5) of this subsection or any other provision of law.

51 which has failed to provide all the audits required by law within the preceding five years."
