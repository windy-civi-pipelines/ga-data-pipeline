A RESOLUTION
1 Honoring the life and memory of Richard B. Sagers; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, born on March 21, 1933, in Stockbridge, Georgia, Richard B. Sagers came of
3 age during a time of segregation and systemic racial discrimination; and
4 WHEREAS, he served as a guardian of this nation's freedom and liberty in the United States
5 Army's 11th Airborne Division, 188th A.I.R., as part of the first all-Black regiment to
6 integrate Fort Campbell, Kentucky; and
7 WHEREAS, following his distinguished military service, he earned his commercial driver's
8 license in 1952, yet he faced widespread racial discrimination as trucking companies
9 systematically refused to hire Black over-the-road drivers, denying them opportunities
10 available to their white counterparts; and
11 WHEREAS, in November 1969, he shattered racial barriers in the transportation industry by
12 becoming the first Black over-the-road driver in the Southern Conference, enduring
13 workplace hostility while opening doors for future generations of Black drivers; and
