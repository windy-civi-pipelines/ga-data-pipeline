Senate Resolution 433
18th, Kirkpatrick of the 32nd and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing March 17, 2025, as Profound Autism Day; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, the definition of autism has evolved over the years, creating an increasingly
3 heterogeneous spectrum, and while all individuals on the autism spectrum deserve
4 recognition and support, profound autism is a term that clarifies the needs of autistic
5 individuals who require 24/7 care from an adult caregiver throughout their lives; and
6 WHEREAS, people with profound autism may also have a severe intellectual disability or
7 have minimal to no language skills, and their unique needs often result in their exclusion
8 from research and support programs; and
9 WHEREAS, in April 2023, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released their
10 first prevalence study on profound autism, concluding that 26.7 percent of 8-year-old
11 children with autism in the United States have profound autism, meaning that one in four
12 children with autism falls into this category; and
13 WHEREAS, the study further found that compared with children with non-profound autism,
14 children with profound autism were more likely to be female, from racial and ethnic minority

15 groups, of low socioeconomic status, born preterm or with low birth weight, have
16 self-injurious behaviors, have seizure disorders, and have lower adaptive scores; and
17 WHEREAS, people with profound autism and those who care for them often live in isolation,
18 necessitating greater inclusion and support, and it is imperative to recognize and address their
19 distinct challenges.
20 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
21 recognize March 17, 2025, as Profound Autism Day.
