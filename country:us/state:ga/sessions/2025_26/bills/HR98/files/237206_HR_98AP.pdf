1552 That the above-described easement area shall be used solely for the construction, installation,
1553 operation, and maintenance of a water tower, underground water, and sewer lines and
1554 associated equipment.
1555 SECTION 222.
1556 That Newton County Water and Sewerage Authority shall have the right to remove or cause
1557 to be removed from said easement area only such trees and bushes as may be reasonably
1558 necessary for the construction, installation, operation, and maintenance of a water tower,
1559 underground water and sewer lines and associated equipment.
1560 SECTION 223.
1561 That, after Newton County Water and Sewerage Authority has put into use the underground

25 HR 98/AP
1574 make any use of said easement area not inconsistent with or detrimental to the rights,

1577 That if the State of Georgia, acting by and through its State Properties Commission,

1579 relocated to an alternate site on state-owned land in order to avoid interference with the
1580 state's use or intended use of the easement area, it may grant a substantially equivalent
1581 non-exclusive easement to allow placement of the removed or relocated facilities across the
1582 alternate site under such terms and conditions as the State Properties Commission shall in its
1583 discretion determine to be in the best interests of the State of Georgia, and Newton County
1584 Water and Sewerage Authority shall remove or relocate its facilities to the alternate easement
1585 area at its sole cost and expense without reimbursement by the State of Georgia unless, in
1586 advance of any construction being commenced, Newton County Water and Sewerage
1587 Authority provides a written estimate for the cost of such removal and relocation and the
1588 State Properties Commission determines, in its sole discretion, that the removal and
1589 relocation is for the sole benefit of the State of Georgia. Upon written request from Newton
1590 County Water and Sewerage Authority or any third party, the State Properties Commission,

1603 or liability of the Georgia Department of Transportation with respect to the state highway
1604 system, or of a county with respect to the county road system or of a municipality with
1605 respect to the city street system. Newton County Water and Sewerage Authority shall obtain
1606 any and all other required permits from the appropriate governmental agencies as are
1607 necessary for its lawful use of the easement area or public highway right of way and comply
1608 with all applicable state and federal environmental statutes in its use of the easement area.
1609 SECTION 228.
1610 That, given the public purpose of the project, the consideration for such easement shall be
1611 $10.00 and such further consideration and provisions as the State Properties Commission
