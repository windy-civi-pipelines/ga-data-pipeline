SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
House Bill (LC 56 0278)
Dear Representative Ballard:
This bill would amend provisions relating to the employment of beneficiaries under the Teachers
Retirement System of Georgia. Current law allows certain retired teachers to return to work full-time and
continue receiving their retirement allowance and any postretirement benefit adjustments they are eligible to
receive. This provision is only available to rehired teachers that are certified for pre-kindergarten through
Grade 12 and are hired for a position that is designated as an area of highest need, as determined for the
Regional Education Service Agency (RESA) in which the school system is assigned. Currently, this provision
is set to expire on June 30, 2026. This bill would extend this provision through June 30, 2030. Additionally,
this bill would move the responsibility for determining the areas of highest need from the RESA to each
individual school district.
This legislation would also expand this benefit, through June 30, 2030, to any beneficiary who returns
to work full-time and has as his or her primary responsibility the academic instruction and support of students
in the area of mathematics, special education, reading, writing, or English language arts, provided such
beneficiary holds a current dyslexia or reading endorsement approved by the Professional Standards
Commission. Beneficiaries rehired under this provision must be retired for at least one year prior to returning
to work in a full-time capacity. It should also be noted that school districts would be required to pay the
employee and employer contributions for any retired teacher hired under these provisions.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems Standards
Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
