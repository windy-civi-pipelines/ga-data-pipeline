House Resolution 263
By: Representative Dubnik of the 29th
A RESOLUTION
2 Board; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, after natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, as well as after
4 school shootings and other public emergencies, recovery must be prioritized as a long-term
5 process rather than merely an immediate response; and
6 WHEREAS, states, districts, and post-secondary institutions have focused on crisis
7 prevention and management but may lack the capacity to provide sustained support for their
8 students, teachers, communities, and even their own counselors during the recovery stage;
9 and
10 WHEREAS, rural districts and institutions in particular tend to have fewer counselors and
11 limited access to additional counseling resources; and
12 WHEREAS, school counselors are often expected to respond to student needs after a tragedy,
13 even as they themselves grapple with the emotional toll, underscoring the need for external
14 support for the entire school community; and

25 LC 112 2913
15 WHEREAS, schools and institutions affected by crises may require at least a year of
16 dedicated support to fully recover; and
17 WHEREAS, recovery efforts can strain resources that are already stretched thin, as
18 demonstrated by a National Center for Education Statistics study showing that less than half
19 of public schools surveyed believe they can provide mental health services to all students in
20 need; and
21 WHEREAS, recovery is an extended healing process for students and adults alike, and
22 having additional counselors come to the aid of a school or institution in extreme need
23 supports the healing process for the entire community, including teachers and counselors at
24 that school; and
25 WHEREAS, specialized training for counselors is essential to ensure that they have
26 psychological first aid training and can provide counseling that aligns with the unique needs
27 of an educational environment; and
28 WHEREAS, research shows that students who receive adequate support after a crisis are
29 more likely to succeed academically, remain in school, and contribute positively to society;
30 and
31 WHEREAS, it is abundantly fitting and proper that this remarkable network be appropriately
32 honored.
33 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
34 the members of this body commend the Crisis Recovery Network coordinated by the
H. R. 263

25 LC 112 2913
35 Southern Regional Education Board for its work to support academic institutions in times of
36 crisis as well as extend best wishes for continued success.
37 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
38 and directed to make an appropriate copy of this resolution available for distribution to the
39 Crisis Recovery Network coordinated by the Southern Regional Education Board.
