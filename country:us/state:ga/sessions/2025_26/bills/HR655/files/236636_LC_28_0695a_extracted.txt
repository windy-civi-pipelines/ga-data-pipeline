House Resolution 655
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the House Study Committee on Gaming in the State of Georgia; and for other
2 purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the Georgia General Assembly has long considered multiple legislative
4 measures to permit the voters of Georgia to decide whether or not to allow the state and its
5 counties to decide whether or not to authorize or opt in to land based destination resort
6 casinos, pari-mutuel and fixed-odds horse racing, and whether or not to permit digital, retail,
7 and on-premise sports betting; and
8 WHEREAS, the General Assembly needs to determine how legalization of gaming in this
9 state if approved by the people and enabled by the General Assembly would contribute to the
10 economy and workforce development of this state as to revenue expectations and quality of
11 jobs being available when weighed against what social and societal ills may come to Georgia
12 if gaming is approved by the citizens of this state; and
13 WHEREAS, the General Assembly needs to determine if the legalization of gaming would

16 WHEREAS, many of our citizens travel substantial distances to engage in gaming activities
17 and enjoy the resort atmosphere in states such as Nevada, Mississippi, Alabama, North
18 Carolina, and Massachusetts; and
19 WHEREAS, if gaming was expanded in this state, the money spent in other states might
20 remain with the industries and tax revenues of this state; and
21 WHEREAS, the State of Georgia has a large agricultural industry that contributes
22 significantly to the economy of this state and a portion of that industry is involved with the
23 breeding, raising, and training of horses; and
24 WHEREAS, the legalization of horse racing and pari-mutuel betting in this state could aid
25 in the further development and expansion of Georgia's horse breeding and raising industry
26 and foster its contribution to the economy of this state; and
27 WHEREAS, the financial implications for the state of such potential legalization as well as
28 previously considered measures by the General Assembly to improve Georgia's economy
29 deserve to be further considered and studied along with the social, fiscal, and economic
30 impacts and the financial viability of such endeavors.
