House Resolution 471
By: Representatives Wade of the 9th and Hawkins of the 27th
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing the historical significance of the 1911 Rand McNally map of Lumpkin County,
2 Georgia; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the 1911 Rand McNally map of Lumpkin County, Georgia, provides a valuable
4 historical snapshot of the region's geography, infrastructure, and cultural landmarks as they
5 existed in the early 20th century; and
6 WHEREAS, this map includes references to significant local features such as the town of
7 Auraria, established in 1832 during Georgia's first gold rush, which briefly served as the
8 county seat and was a bustling center for gold mining activities; over time, its prominence
9 declined, and today it is considered a ghost town with only a few remaining structures; and
10 WHEREAS, the map also highlights other communities that were once integral to the
11 county's social and economic fabric but have since diminished or disappeared, including
12 Porter Springs, a thriving health resort in the late 1800s and early 1900s known for its
13 mineral springs; and
14 WHEREAS, the map illustrates the layout of early transportation networks, including
15 roadways and settlements that shaped the development of small towns and rural communities

16 within Lumpkin County, such as Wahoo, which had a population of 55 in 1900, and Grace,
17 both of which were principal trading points in the region less than 10 miles from Dahlonega;
18 and
19 WHEREAS, many of the communities, settlements, and named locations on the map reflect
20 a way of life that has since evolved due to industrialization, urbanization, and shifts in
21 economic and social structuresâ€”even the towns of Stay and Tworun, once known as fertile
22 regions, saw opportunities dry up and shift toward Dahlonega; and
23 WHEREAS, preserving and recognizing this historical cartographic record allows for a
24 deeper appreciation of the county's heritage and provides insight into how landscapes such
25 as Duke's Creek and its yellow metal in 1828 shaped the area and the state; and
26 WHEREAS, the study and commemoration of these lost landmarks contribute to the broader
27 understanding of Georgia's small-town history and the forces that shaped its development
28 throughout the 20th century.
29 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
30 the members of this body recognize the historical significance of the 1911 Rand McNally
31 map of Lumpkin County, Georgia, and encourage further efforts to document, study, and
32 educate the public about the county's evolving geography and cultural legacy.
33 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
34 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
35 public and the press.
