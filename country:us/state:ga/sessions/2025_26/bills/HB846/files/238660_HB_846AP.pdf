17 O.C.G.A., as amended, for the immediately preceding taxable year as determined by the tax
18 commissioner of Cherokee County. This homestead exemption shall commence on January

21 amended. The value of that property in excess of such exempted amount shall remain subject
22 to taxation.
23 (c) A person shall not receive the homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this
24 section unless such person or person's agent files an application with the tax commissioner
25 of Cherokee County, giving the person's age and such additional information relative to
26 receiving such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner of Cherokee County to make
27 a determination regarding the initial and continuing eligibility of such person for such
28 exemption. The tax commissioner of Cherokee County shall provide application forms for
29 this purpose.
30 (d) The exemption shall be claimed and returned as provided in Code Section 48-5-50.1 of
31 the O.C.G.A., as amended. The exemption shall be automatically renewed from year to year
32 so long as the person granted the homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this section
33 occupies the residence as a homestead. After a person has filed the proper application as
34 provided in subsection (c) of this section, it shall not be necessary to make application
35 thereafter for any year, and the exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It
36 shall be the duty of any person granted the homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this
37 section to notify the tax commissioner of Cherokee County in the event that such person for
38 any reason becomes ineligible for such exemption.
39 (e) The exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to or affect any
40 state ad valorem taxes, county or independent school district ad valorem taxes for educational
41 purposes, or municipal ad valorem taxes for municipal purposes. The homestead exemption
42 granted by subsection (b) of this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other
43 homestead exemption applicable to Cherokee County ad valorem taxes for county purposes.
