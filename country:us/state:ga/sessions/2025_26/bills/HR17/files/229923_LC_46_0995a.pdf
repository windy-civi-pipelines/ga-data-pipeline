14 WHEREAS, more than eight million citizens of this country honorably served during the
15 Vietnam War, during which time the chemical Agent Orange was widely used in Vietnam
16 by the United States Armed Forces as part of Operation Ranch Hand, the herbicidal warfare
17 program, between 1961 and 1971; and
18 WHEREAS, nearly 20 million gallons of the orange powder were sprayed over the land
19 from helicopters or low-flying aircraft, destroying vegetation and crops in order to deprive
20 enemy guerrillas of food and cover for their activities, which exposed 2.6 million American
21 soldiers to the herbicide and defoliant chemical; and
22 WHEREAS, Agent Orange is a dioxin and cancer-causing chemical that enters the body
23 through physical contact or ingestion and moves into the human cell nucleus, where it attacks
24 the genes and causes a number of serious illnesses, including leukemia, lymphoma,
25 myeloma, ischemic heart disease, soft tissue sarcoma, amyloidosis, diabetes, and cancers of
26 the throat, prostate, lung, and colon; and
27 WHEREAS, Agent Orange also causes genetic damage, and in some cases, the children and
28 grandchildren of veterans exposed to Agent Orange have been born with spina bifida and
29 other abnormalities; and
30 WHEREAS, today, approximately 800,000 Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange are
31 alive, and approximately 300 deaths occur among them every day; and
32 WHEREAS, while fallen comrades are memorialized on The Wall at the Vietnam Veterans
33 Memorial in Washington, D.C., the veterans who are victims of Agent Orange are not
34 recognized as fatalities of the Vietnam War; and

35 WHEREAS, it is most appropriate that we should honor these veterans to the full extent of
36 our ability, as they have made untold and innumerable sacrifices to preserve the liberties we
37 enjoy today and that our progeny will hopefully continue to cherish for generations to come.
38 NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
39 the members of this body honor and recognize the veterans who were victims of Agent
40 Orange during the Vietnam War for their courageous service to our nation as some of
41 America's most heroic citizens.
42 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
43 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
44 public.
