House Resolution 712
By: Representatives Park of the 107th, Hugley of the 141st, Miller of the 62nd, Frye of the
122nd, Williams of the 168th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the House Study Committee on Protecting Working Families; and for other
2 purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the State of Georgia receives approximately $19 billion from the federal
4 government and any federal budget cuts will require the General Assembly to significantly
5 slash funding, which will negatively affect Georgians' salaries, quality of life, access to
6 healthcare, and ability to access essential services; and
7 WHEREAS, reductions in federal Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
8 (SNAP) funding will have a significant negative impact on certain vulnerable populations,
9 small businesses, rural communities, veterans, and first responders in this state; and
10 WHEREAS, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health, nearly 2.5 million
11 Georgians rely on Medicaid, including low-income working families, children, seniors, and
12 people with disabilities, and any reduction in federal Medicaid funding could lead to higher
13 uninsured rates, more expensive health insurance plans for families and employers, and an
14 increased financial strain on hospitals, particularly in rural areas; and
15 WHEREAS, over 1.4 million Georgians depend on SNAP benefits to afford basic nutrition,
16 with working families, single parents, and low-income seniors being among the largest

17 recipients, and reductions in SNAP funding could result in higher food insecurity rates,
18 increased pressure on food banks, and negative health outcomes for vulnerable populations;
19 and
20 WHEREAS, food insecurity remains a pressing issue in Georgia, with 13.1 percent of
21 residents (approximately 1 in 8) experiencing food insecurity, including 18.4 percent of
22 children (approximately 1 in 5), and the demand for food assistance has surged due to rising
23 grocery prices and economic challenges; and
24 WHEREAS, working families in Georgia already face rising healthcare costs, limited access
25 to health insurance, and disparities in maternal health outcomes, disproportionately affecting
26 women, children, and communities of color; and
27 WHEREAS, Georgia has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country (13.4 percent), and
28 cuts to Medicaid funding could further erode access to affordable healthcare for working
29 families and small business employees; and
30 WHEREAS, Georgia ranks among the worst states for maternal mortality, with Black
31 mothers facing a mortality rate more than twice that of white mothers, and expanded
32 Medicaid access has been shown to improve maternal health outcomes; and
33 WHEREAS, over 152,000 women in Georgia live in maternity care deserts, putting them at
34 greater risk of adverse health outcomes due to lack of accessible and equitable maternal care;
35 and
36 WHEREAS, the loss of SNAP and Medicaid benefits would have cascading economic
37 effects, including reduced consumer spending, financial strain on small businesses and the
38 state, and increased uncompensated care costs for hospitals and healthcare providers; and

39 WHEREAS, strengthening state based protections, such as emergency Medicaid funds, food
40 security programs, and small business tax incentives, can help mitigate the negative impacts
41 of federal policy changes and ensure that working families, first responders, veterans, and
42 vulnerable populations continue to have access to essential healthcare and nutrition; and
43 WHEREAS, the Georgia legislature understands that certain state-driven protections may be
44 necessary to ensure that these individuals, businesses, and communities continue to have
45 access to essential healthcare and food security benefits, including, but not limited to, the
46 following protections:
47 (1) State emergency Medicaid fund. The fund would provide healthcare coverage to
48 individuals who lose Medicaid benefits due to federal policy changes;
49 (2) State food security fund. The fund would provide grocery assistance benefits to
50 first responders, veterans, and other eligible individuals equivalent to any loss of SNAP
51 benefits due to federal policy changes;
52 (3) Small business tax credits. Small business employers would receive tax credits for
53 making certain healthcare contributions related to responding to reductions in Medicaid
54 funding;
55 (4) Affordable insurance pool for small businesses. Individuals affected by reductions
56 in Medicaid funding would have the option to participate in and have access to subsidized
57 healthcare coverage;
58 (5) State funded food purchase program. The state would purchase and distribute
59 local produce, dairy, and meat to food banks, K-12 schools, senior meal programs, and
60 families with an incarcerated parent or a parent recently released from incarceration;
61 (6) State funded Medicaid buy-in program. Individuals who lose Medicaid benefits
62 due to federal policy changes would be permitted to purchase state sponsored coverage
63 at subsidized rates;
64 (7) State funded maternity care grants. Pregnant women from low-income
65 households, children in households that lose access to benefits under Medicaid or the

66 Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and low-income mothers denied abortion
67 access due to state restrictions would receive direct financial assistance from the state for
68 maternity healthcare expenses; and
69 (8) State funded grants to food assistance organizations. Church-run pantries and
70 religious, nonprofit organizations would receive state dollar-for-dollar matching grants
71 to support their existing efforts of providing food assistance; and
72 WHEREAS, a study is needed to evaluate these protections and others, determine policy
73 goals, and identify appropriate legislative actions to mitigate any adverse impact of federal
74 Medicaid and SNAP funding changes on these individuals, businesses, and communities.
