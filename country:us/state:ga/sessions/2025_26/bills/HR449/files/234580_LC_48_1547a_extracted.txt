House Resolution 449
and Roberts of the 52nd
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the House Study Committee on Modernization of the Traffic Violations Bureau; and
2 for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the state's traffic violations bureau (TVB) laws, a system that allows drivers
4 accused of certain traffic violations to pay their fines online or by mail and never appear in
5 a courtroom, is a great convenience to both motorists and the courts, but, as written, these
6 laws can allow drivers who commit dangerous acts on our streets and highways to totally
7 avoid both prosecutorial and judicial supervision; and
8 WHEREAS, persons injured in, or who have damages brought upon them, due to traffic
9 accidents can be deprived of their rights to make victim impact statements; and
10 WHEREAS, enacted in March, 1966, the TVB system is likely unconstitutional as there is
11 no requirement that defendants be advised of their rights as were created by the Miranda v.
12 Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) decision, rendering the system outdated, confusing, and
13 fraught with danger to drivers who pay fines using the TVB system; and
