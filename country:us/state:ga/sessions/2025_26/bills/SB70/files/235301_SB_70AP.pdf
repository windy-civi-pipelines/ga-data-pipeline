25 LC 44 2889
371 (b) The powers enumerated in this section are cumulative of and in addition to those powers
372 enumerated herein and elsewhere in this Act, and no such power shall limit or restrict any
373 other power of the board.
374 (c) The powers enumerated in this section are conferred for an essential governmental
375 function for a public purpose, and the revenues and debt of any district are not subject to
376 taxation.
377 SECTION 11.
378 Bonds generally.
379 (a) Notes or other obligations issued by a district other than general obligation bonds shall
380 be paid solely from the property pledged to pay such notes or other obligations. General
381 obligation bonds issued by any district shall constitute a general obligation of the district to
382 the repayment of which the full faith, credit and taxing power of the district shall be pledged.
383 (b) All bonds, notes, and other obligations of any district shall be authorized by resolution
384 of its board, adopted by a majority vote of the board members at a regular or special meeting.
385 (c) Bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time
386 or times (not more than 30 years from their respective dates), shall bear interest at such rate
387 or rates (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time), shall
388 be subject to redemption on such terms, and shall contain such other terms, provisions,
389 covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such
390 bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide. The terms, provisions, covenants,
391 assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the
392 board authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the board
393 members of the district then in office and their successors.
394 (d) The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to
395 refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded
396 have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for
S. B. 70

397 any other purpose permitted by this Act. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the
398 bonds to be refunded, with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon, or may be sold and
399 the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.
400 (e) There shall be no limitation upon the interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates
401 on any bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district; the usury laws of this State shall not
402 apply to bonds, notes, or other obligations of these districts.
403 (f) Bonds issued by a district may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered, or both
404 coupon and fully registered and may be subject to such exchangeability and transferability
405 provisions as the bond resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or as any indenture
406 or trust agreement may provide.
407 (g) Bonds issued by a district shall be validated and in accordance with Article 3 of Chapter
408 82 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A., known as the "Revenue Bond Law," or in accordance with
409 such other successor provision governing bond validation generally as may be provided by
410 law. The signature of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Rockdale County shall be made on
411 the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the
412 date on which such bonds were validated; such entry shall be original evidence of the fact
413 of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this State.
414 (h) In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which such bonds are to bear, and the
415 principal amount and maturities of such bonds, the notice to the district attorney or the
416 attorney general, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing,
417 and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear
418 interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed
419 or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) and that the principal amount will
420 not exceed and the final maturity date will not be later than as specified in such notices and
421 petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of
422 interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which
423 may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided,
424 however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right
S. B. 70
- 17 -

25 LC 44 2889
425 of a board to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost
426 resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such
427 notices and in the petition and complaint.
428 (i) The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning
429 prescribed herein whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in
430 bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices or proceedings to validate such
431 bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district.
432 SECTION 12.
433 Authorized contents of agreements and instruments of board generally; use of proceeds of
434 sale of bonds, notes and other obligations; subsequent issues thereof.
435 (a) Subject to the limitations and procedures provided by this section and by the immediately
436 preceding section, the agreements or instruments executed by a board may contain such
437 provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by such board.
438 (b) The proceeds derived from the sale of all bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by
439 a district shall be held and used for the ultimate purpose of paying, directly or indirectly as
440 permitted by this Act, all or part of the cost of any project, or for the purpose of refunding
441 any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued in accordance with this Act.
442 (c) Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one
443 or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or obligations in
444 connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any
445 subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior
446 loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior
447 issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior
448 issuance the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other
449 obligations on a parity with such prior issuance.

455 SECTION 14.
456 Dissolution.
457 (a)(1) Any district activated under the provisions of this Act may be dissolved.
458 (2) The conditions for such dissolution shall be:
459 (A) The adoption of a resolution approving of the dissolution of such community
460 improvement district by the governing authority of the City of Conyers; and
461 (B) The written consent to the dissolution of the community improvement district by:
462 (i) A majority of the owners of real property within the district which are subject to
463 taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the district; and
464 (ii) The owners of real property constituting at least 75 percent by value of all real
465 property within the district which are subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by
466 the board. For this purpose, value shall be determined by the most recent approved
467 county ad valorem tax digest.
468 (3) The written consents provided for in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of this
469 subsection shall be submitted to the Rockdale County Tax Commissioner, who shall certify
470 whether subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of this subsection has been satisfied with
471 respect to each proposed district dissolution.
472 (b) In the event that successful action is taken pursuant to this section to dissolve the district,
473 the dissolution shall become effective at such time as all debt obligations of the district have
474 been satisfied. Following a successful dissolution action and until the dissolution becomes
S. B. 70
- 19 -

25 LC 44 2889
475 effective, no new projects may be undertaken, obligations or debts incurred, or property
476 acquired.
477 (c) Upon a successful dissolution action, all noncash assets of the district other than public
478 facilities or land or easements to be used for such public facilities, as described in Section 2
479 of this Act, shall be reduced to cash and, along with all other cash on hand, shall be applied
480 to the repayment of any debt obligation of the district. Any cash remaining after all
481 outstanding obligations are satisfied shall be remitted to the City of Conyers.
482 (d) When a dissolution becomes effective, the City of Conyers shall take title to all property
483 previously in the ownership of the district, and all taxes, fees, and assessments of the district
484 shall cease to be levied and collected.
485 (e) A district may be reactivated in the same manner as an original activation.
486 (f) In the event that any district shall be dissolved in accordance with this section, the board
487 shall serve until December 31 of the year in which dissolution was approved for the purpose
488 of concluding any ongoing matters and projects. However, if such ongoing matters and
489 projects cannot be concluded by December 31 of such year, then the governing authority of
490 the City of Conyers shall assume the duties of the board and shall be expressly authorized
491 to exercise the authority of the board of the dissolved district. In the alternative, the
492 governing authority of the City of Conyers may, by resolution, assume all rights and
493 obligations of the district, either bonds or otherwise, and the district shall cease to exist upon
494 the adoption of such resolution.
495 SECTION 15.
