45 (c) The commissioner shall establish an application process for certifying exempted
46 mortgage loan originators as qualified organizations and shall publicly maintain a list of
47 such qualified organizations.
48 (d)(1) Prior to making a contribution to any qualified organization, the taxpayer shall
49 electronically request preapproval from the department, in a manner specified by the
50 commissioner, of the total amount of the contribution that such taxpayer intends to make.
51 (2) Within 30 days after receiving such a request, the commissioner shall preapprove,
52 deny, or prorate requested amounts on a first come, first served basis and shall provide
53 notice to such taxpayer and the qualified organization of such preapproval, denial, or
54 proration. Such notices shall not require any signed release or notarized approval by the
55 taxpayer. The commissioner shall base such preapproval solely on the availability of tax
56 credits subject to the aggregate limit established under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of
57 this Code section.
58 (3) Within 60 days after receiving such preapproval notice, the taxpayer shall contribute
59 the preapproved amount to the qualified organization or such preapproved contribution
60 amount shall expire. The commissioner shall not include such expired amounts in
61 determining the remaining amount available under the aggregate limit for the respective
62 calendar year.

64 of contribution, which shall include the taxpayer's name, address, tax identification
65 number, the amount of the qualified contribution, the date of the qualified contribution,
66 and the total amount of the credit allowed to the taxpayer.
67 (2) To claim the tax credit allowed under this Code section, the taxpayer shall attach to
68 the taxpayer's tax return the letter provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection. If the
H. B. 357

25 LC 62 0083
69 taxpayer files an electronic return, such letter shall be required to be electronically
70 attached to the return only if the Internal Revenue Service allows such attachments to be
71 affixed and transmitted to the department. In the event the taxpayer files an electronic
72 tax return and such confirmation is not attached because the Internal Revenue Service
73 does not, at the time of such electronic filing, allow electronic attachments to the Georgia
74 tax return, such confirmation shall be maintained by the taxpayer and made available
75 upon request by the commissioner.
76 (3) The commissioner shall allow tax credits for any preapproved contributions made to
77 an exempted mortgage loan originator if such exempted mortgage loan originator was a
78 qualified organization at the time of the commissioner's preapproval of the contributions
79 and the taxpayer has otherwise complied with this Code section.
80 (f)(1) A taxpayer shall not be allowed to designate or direct the taxpayer's qualified
81 contributions to any particular purpose or for the direct benefit of any particular
82 individual.
83 (2) A taxpayer that operates, owns, or is a subsidiary of an association, organization, or
84 other entity that contracts directly with a qualified organization shall not be eligible for
85 tax credits allowed under this Code section for contributions made to such qualified
86 organization.
87 (3) In soliciting contributions, no person shall represent or direct that, in exchange for
88 making qualified contributions to any qualified organization, a taxpayer shall receive any
89 direct or particular benefit. The status as a qualified organization shall be revoked for any
90 qualified organization determined to be in violation of this paragraph and shall not be
91 renewed for at least two years.
92 (g)(1) No qualified organization shall use more than 10 percent of qualified contributions
93 for administrative expenses or overhead. Each qualified organization shall maintain
94 accurate and current records of all expenditures of such funds and provide such records
95 to the commissioner upon request.

96 (2) A qualified organization that fails to comply with any of the requirements of this
97 Code section shall be given written notice by the department of such failure to comply
98 by certified mail and shall have 90 days from the receipt of such notice to correct all
99 deficiencies.
100 (3) Upon failure to correct all deficiencies within 90 days, the department shall revoke
101 the exempted mortgage loan originator's status as a qualified organization and such entity
102 shall be immediately removed from the department's list of qualified organizations.
103 (4) Each exempted mortgage loan originator that has had its status revoked pursuant to
104 this Code section shall immediately cease all expenditures of funds received pursuant to
105 this Code section and shall transfer all of such funds that are not yet expended to a
106 properly operating qualified organization within 30 calendar days of such revocation.
107 (h)(1) No credit shall be allowed under this Code section to a taxpayer for any amount
108 of qualified contributions that were utilized as deductions or exemptions from taxable
109 income.
110 (2) In no event shall the total amount of the tax credit under this Code section for a
111 taxable year exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability. Any unused tax credit shall be
112 allowed the taxpayer against the succeeding five years' tax liability. No such credit shall
113 be allowed the taxpayer against prior years' tax liability.
114 (i) The commissioner shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement and
115 administer the provisions of this Code section."
116 SECTION 2.
117 This Act shall become effective on January 1, 2026, and shall be applicable to taxable years
118 beginning on or after such date.
119 SECTION 3.
120 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
