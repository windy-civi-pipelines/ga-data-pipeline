185 automated traffic enforcement safety device is located if such motor vehicle is found, as
186 evidenced by photographically recorded images, to have been operated in disregard or

268 class first-class mail a second notice of any unpaid civil monetary penalty, except in cases
269 where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful
270 determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. No late fee shall be
271 imposed for any unpaid civil monetary penalty imposed under this Code section. The
272 second notice shall include all information required in paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of

297 the assessed penalty has not been paid, the agent or governing body shall send to the person
298 who is the registered owner of the motor vehicle a final notice of any unpaid civil monetary
299 penalty authorized by this Code section, except in cases where there is an adjudication that

301 penalty shall be imposed. The notice shall inform the registered owner that the agent or
302 governing body shall send a referral to the Department of Revenue if the assessed penalty
