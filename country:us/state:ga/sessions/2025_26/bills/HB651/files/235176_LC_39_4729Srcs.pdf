113 processing of such civil monetary penalty which shall not exceed $25.00; provided,

118 (2) A law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the speed limit of a school zone, or
119 an agent working on behalf of a law enforcement agency or governing body, shall send

123 Department of Revenue but no later than 60 days after the date of the alleged violation:
124 (A) A citation for the alleged violation, which shall include the date and time of the

140 authorized by law;
141 (E) A statement of the inference provided by paragraph (4) of this subsection and of
142 the means specified therein by which such inference may be rebutted;
143 (F) Information advising the owner of the motor vehicle of the manner in which

149 right to contest liability;
150 (3) Proof that a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed

153 law enforcement agency and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically
154 recorded images, a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed
155 limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not

164 violation. Such an inference may be rebutted if the owner of the vehicle:
165 (A) Testifies under oath in open court or submits to the court a sworn notarized
166 statement that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged
167 violation; or

- 7 -

LC 39 4729S
172 points assessment under Code Section 40-5-57. Such violation shall be deemed
173 noncriminal, and imposition of a civil warning or civil monetary penalty pursuant to this
174 Code section shall not be deemed a conviction and shall not be made a part of the operating
175 record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed, nor shall it be used for any
176 insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.
177 (d) If a person issued and mailed a citation pursuant to subsection (b) of this Code section
178 fails to pay the civil monetary penalty for the violation or has not filed a police report or
179 notarized statement pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection (b) of this Code section in no
180 less than 30 nor more than 60 days after such mailing as determined and noticed by the law
181 enforcement agency, the agent or law enforcement agency shall send to such person by first
182 class first-class mail a second notice of any unpaid civil monetary penalty, except in cases
183 where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful
184 determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. The second notice shall
185 include all information required in paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this Code section and
186 shall include a new date of return by which the civil monetary penalty shall be paid which
187 shall be no less than 30 days after such mailing as determined and noticed by the law
188 enforcement agency. If such person notified by second notice again fails to pay the civil
189 monetary penalty or file a police report or notarized statement pursuant to paragraph (4)
190 of subsection (b) of this Code section by the new date of return included in the notice, such
191 person shall have waived the right to contest the violation and shall be liable for the civil
192 monetary penalty provided for under this Code section, except in cases where there is an
193 adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful determination that no
194 civil monetary penalty shall be imposed.
195 (e) Notices mailed by first class first-class mail pursuant to this Code section shall be
196 adequate notification of the fees and penalties imposed by this Code section. No other
197 notice shall be required for the purposes of this Code section.

201 provided in this subsection, the provisions of law governing jurisdiction, procedure,
202 defenses, adjudication, appeal, and payment and distribution of penalties otherwise
203 applicable to violations of subsection (a) of this Code section shall apply to enforcement

205 however, that any appeal from superior or state court shall be by application in the same
206 manner as that provided by Code Section 5-6-35.

208 agent or governing body shall send to the person who is the registered owner of the motor
209 vehicle a final notice of any unpaid civil monetary penalty authorized by this Code section,
210 except in cases where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is
211 otherwise a lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. The
212 notice shall inform the registered owner that the agent or governing body shall send a
213 referral to the Department of Revenue if the assessed penalty is not paid within 30 days
214 after the final notice was mailed and of the consequences for failure to pay such penalty

217 sooner than 30 days after the final notice required under subsection (g) was mailed if a
218 violation has not been contested and the assessed penalty has not been paid, except in cases
219 where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful
220 determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. The referral to the
