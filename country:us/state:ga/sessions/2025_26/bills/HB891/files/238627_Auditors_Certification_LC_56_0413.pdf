SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
House Bill (LC 56 0413)
Dear Representative Williams:
This bill would amend provisions relating to the Georgia State Employees' Pension and Saving (GSEPS)
Plan, which is under the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia. Currently, persons covered under the
GSEPS Plan make employee contributions equal to 1 ¼ percent of their earnable compensation. If this
legislation is enacted, the employee contributions for members covered under the GSEPS Plan would
increase to 3 percent of earnable compensation effective July 1, 2026. This bill would also authorize the
board of trustees to determine the employee contribution rate going forward. However, the rate may not
be less than 3 percent or be more than 4 percent.
Additionally, this bill would provide for an increase in the retirement allowance for persons covered under
the GSEPS Plan. Currently, such members are eligible to receive a retirement allowance of 1 percent for
each year of creditable service earned. If this legislation is enacted, members would receive a retirement
allowance equal to 1 percent for each year of creditable service earned prior to July 1, 2026 and 1 ½ percent
for each year of creditable service earned beginning July 1, 2026.
It should be noted that the changes included in this bill would not have any impact on employee and
employer contribution percentages being paid into the defined contribution accounts for GSEPS members.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems
Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
