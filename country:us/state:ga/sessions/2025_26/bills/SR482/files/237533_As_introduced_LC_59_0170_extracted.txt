A RESOLUTION
1 Urging the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) to create a study committee for the
2 purpose of making recommendations to the Senate with regard to how the State of Georgia
3 can use advanced nuclear reactors to increase power generation and economic development
4 in this state; and for other purposes.
5 WHEREAS, advanced nuclear reactors (ANRs) are capable of supporting Georgia's growing
6 energy needs by providing clean, reliable power for urban centers, industrial facilities, data
7 centers, and desalination plants; and
8 WHEREAS, nuclear power is more reliable than coal, wind, and solar power, offering the
9 resilience essential for everyday use and extreme weather conditions; and
10 WHEREAS, ANRs can co-locate with data centers and support heavy industries by
11 providing process heat and powering desalination plants, enhancing production, and creating
12 high wage jobs across this state; and

16 WHEREAS, the global nuclear market is projected to triple by 2050, and establishing
17 Georgia as the preferred supplier for American ANR technology can open international
18 opportunities and offer an alternative to Chinese and Russian nuclear reactor technology for
19 allies and partners; and
20 WHEREAS, with enhanced safety, scalability, and integration potential, ANRs are a key
21 solution for Georgia's energy reliability and stability to meet the growing energy demands
22 of this state; and
23 WHEREAS, Georgia can gain competitive advantages by cutting red tape and establishing
24 incentives to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment, overcome regulatory hurdles, and
25 attract investment to solidify Georgia as the global nuclear energy hub.
26 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
27 urge the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) to create a study committee for the
28 purpose of making recommendations to the Senate with regard to how the State of Georgia
