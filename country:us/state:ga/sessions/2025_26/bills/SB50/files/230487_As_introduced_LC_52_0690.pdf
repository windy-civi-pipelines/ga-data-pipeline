12 SECTION 2.
13 The General Assembly finds that:
14 (1) Expanding access to coverage for essential healthcare needs to Georgians earning up
15 to 138 percent of the federal poverty limit will improve the quality and availability of
16 healthcare services in this state;
17 (2) It is important that federal reimbursement remain at current rates to allow the State of
18 Georgia to provide such coverage;
19 (3) Providing coverage via fully subsidized commercial insurance products on the
20 Section 1332 marketplace in Georgia will give individuals more options in coverage and
21 help ensure that healthcare providers may commercially contract for services and receive
22 fair reimbursement for providing such services;
23 (4) The request for a federal waiver to provide these services should protect the fiscal
24 stability of the state, avoid tax increases, not contain matters that would diminish the
25 likelihood of approval, and be bipartisan in nature;
26 (5) Fair reimbursement rates and added flexibility to innovate in healthcare delivery will
27 help attract essential healthcare providers to Georgia; and
28 (6) The General Assembly, through the Advisory Commission on the PeachCare Plus
29 Program, should maintain an active oversight role in preparation and submission of the
30 waiver.
31 SECTION 3.
32 Article 7 of Chapter 4 of Title 49 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to
33 medical assistance generally, is amended by revising Code Section 49-4-142.2, relating to
34 expansion of Medicaid eligibility through an increase in the income threshold, as follows:
35 "49-4-142.2.
36 (a) On and after July 1, 2014, neither the department, the board, nor any other
37 representative of the state shall expand Medicaid eligibility under this article through an

38 increase in the income threshold without prior legislative approval; provided, however, that

40 poverty level. The legislative approval required under this Code section shall be by Act
41 of the General Assembly or the adoption of a joint resolution of the General Assembly.
42 (b) This Code section shall not apply to a waiver request along with other necessary
43 amendments for the creation of the PeachCare Plus Program pursuant to Code

52 Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pursuant to Section 1115 of
53 the federal Social Security Act a waiver request along with other necessary amendments
54 for the creation of the PeachCare Plus Program. The waiver request shall provide for:
