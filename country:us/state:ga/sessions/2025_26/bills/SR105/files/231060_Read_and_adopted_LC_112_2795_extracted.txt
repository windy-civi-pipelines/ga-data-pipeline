25 LC 112 2795
15 WHEREAS, Georgia's animal shelters can achieve a 90 percent save rate if more Georgians
16 seeking a pet choose to adopt from a shelter rather than purchase, which would make Georgia
17 the largest state to date with a save rate exceeding 90 percent; and
18 WHEREAS, many Georgia shelters are no-kill, saving at least 90 percent of the animals they
19 intake by implementing proven programs and policies as alternatives, such as foster care
20 networks, adoption programs, medical and behavioral programs, public education and
21 awareness initiatives, community cat trap-neuter-vaccinate-return programs, and animal
22 socialization programs; and
23 WHEREAS, Georgians can work together to achieve "No-Kill" in this state by 2025, and
24 animal shelters can help accomplish this by implementing lifesaving programs and utilizing
25 the support of rescues and nonprofits.
26 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
27 commend animal shelter workers and volunteers as well as community members who support
28 their local animal shelters and recognize April 30, 2025, as No-Kill Awareness Day at the
29 state capitol to raise awareness about dog and cat adoption and the importance of "No-Kill"
30 animal shelters.
31 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
32 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and the
33 press.
