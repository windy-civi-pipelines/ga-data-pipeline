15 WHEREAS, in 2012, the Barrows, through the Wormsloe Foundation, donated 15 acres of
16 land to the UGA Libraries to establish the Center for Research and Education at Wormsloe
17 (CREW), creating a dynamic environment for student and faculty discovery, research, and
18 experiential learning; and
19 WHEREAS, the Barrows further played a crucial role in the development and success of the
20 UGA Libraries' Board of Visitors, which was instrumental in securing private funding to
21 construct the Russell Special Collections Building; and
22 WHEREAS, their contributions have built upon a legacy deeply intertwined with the UGA
23 Libraries, as Craig Barrow's ancestor, Wymberly Jones De Renne, assembled the most
24 significant private collection of books and manuscripts on Georgia at Wormsloe, which was
25 donated to UGA in 1938; and
26 WHEREAS, the Barrows' enduring generosity, leadership, and passion for education and
27 preservation have transformed their family's historical connection to UGA into a lasting
28 legacy that will benefit generations of scholars, researchers, and students.
29 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
