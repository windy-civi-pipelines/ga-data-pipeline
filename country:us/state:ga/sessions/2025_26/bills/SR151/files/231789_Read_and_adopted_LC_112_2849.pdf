Senate Resolution 151
By: Senators Brass of the 6th, Walker III of the 20th, Anavitarte of the 31st, Hatchett of the
50th, Payne of the 54th and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing February 26, 2025, as Self-Direction Day; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, self-direction is an optional model of home and community-based service
3 (HCBS) delivery that enables individuals of all ages, with all types of disabilities, to maintain
4 their independence at home in their local community; and
5 WHEREAS, when an individual chooses to self-direct, they decide how, when, and from
6 whom their services and paid supports will be delivered; self-direction gives individuals the
7 freedom of choice and self-determination about their services and supports to live
8 independently in their own homes and communities; and
9 WHEREAS, the central goal of self-direction is to maximize an individual's opportunities
10 to live independently in the most integrated community-based setting of his or her choice;
11 and
12 WHEREAS, self-direction strategies shift control over resources and staffing to the
13 individual, allowing each person to determine the role that service providers will play in his
14 or her life; and

15 WHEREAS, a range of benefits have been noted when individuals participate in self-directed
16 services, including improved satisfaction with support services, better quality of life, reduced
17 costs compared to provider-directed services, and less institutional stays; and
18 WHEREAS, the program also empowers individuals participating in public programs and
19 their families by expanding their degree of choice and control over their long-term services
20 and supports; and
21 WHEREAS, self-direction further provides attractive alternatives to individuals who find the
22 traditional services system inflexible, as well as those who have been unable to receive all
23 the services they need; and
24 WHEREAS, self-direction was implemented in Georgia beginning with a small number of
25 participants in the Independent Care Waiver Program in April 2005; and
26 WHEREAS, to date, the self-direction model is available in Georgia in five different Home
27 and Community-Based Waiver Programs, which provide the elderly and disabled with
28 necessary medical care and services.
29 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
30 recognize February 26, 2025, as Self-Direction Day.
31 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
32 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and the
33 press.
