25 LC 46 1159
15 SECTION 1.
16 The General Assembly finds that:
17 (1) Georgia has prioritized advancements in access to mental health care and addressing
18 issues of maternal health and maternal mortality;
19 (2) The largest demographic of Americans grappling with depression is women of
20 childbearing age. The mental well-being of women before, during, and after giving birth
21 is a matter of significant concern for women, their families, their communities, and their
22 healthcare providers. This issue is of particular interest to the General Assembly in that it
23 has far-reaching impact on the public health and the welfare of people in this state;
24 (3) Maternal mental health conditions are among the most common complications of
25 pregnancy and childbirth;
26 (4) Statistics from experts in the field show that one in five perinatal women will
27 experience mood and anxiety disorders at some time during the period spanning from
28 pregnancy through 12 months after the birth of a child;
29 (5) Maternal depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders can be debilitating conditions,
30 but they are treatable if properly diagnosed;
31 (6) Early identification and treatment of maternal mental health conditions significantly
32 improves outcomes for mothers and children;
33 (7) Children born to mothers with untreated depression face a higher likelihood of
34 encountering developmental challenges and increased utilization of medical and mental
35 health services throughout their lives;
36 (8) It is imperative, then, in order to protect and promote public health and welfare, to
37 ensure the prompt diagnosis and treatment of women experiencing postpartum depression
38 or other maternal mental health disorders;

H. B. 649

25 LC 46 1159
41 Pediatrics recommend perinatal mental health screenings at certain intervals for all
42 pregnant and postpartum women;
43 (10) Universal maternal mental health screening questionnaires test for the presence of
44 prenatal or postpartum mood disorders through validated, evidence based tools;
45 (11) These screening questionnaires are available at little to no cost;
46 (12) In order to preserve and promote maternal health and strong families, it is imperative
47 that the State of Georgia provide access to periodic mental health screening questionnaires
48 for women throughout and after their pregnancies; and
49 (13) There is a critical need to ensure equitable access to maternal mental health screening
50 and care across Georgia, particularly in rural and other underserved communities.
