Senate Resolution 207
Jackson of the 41st and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Urging the General Assembly to appropriate an additional $2 million annually to the Georgia
2 Pregnancy and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, in lieu of all moneys currently
3 being appropriated to fund crisis pregnancy centers; and for other purposes.
4 WHEREAS, this resolution shall be named the "Fund Healthy Pregnancy and Parenting
5 Resolution"; and
6 WHEREAS, in the Fiscal Year 2026 budget, the Governor has supported adding
7 $2.98 million to increase funds to expand a pilot program to provide in-home visits for at-risk
8 and underserved rural communities during pregnancy and early childhood to improve birth
9 outcomes, reduce preterm deliveries, and decrease infant and maternal mortality rates; and
10 WHEREAS, this program shall be referred to as the Georgia Pregnancy and Early Childhood
11 Home Visiting Program; and
12 WHEREAS, this program as administered by the Department of Public Health has produced
13 positive outcomes and is worthy of increased support; and

25 LC 46 1116
15 WHEREAS, crisis pregnancy centers are often fronts for antiabortion activities; and
16 WHEREAS, the main purpose of these centers is often to coerce pregnant populations,
17 especially those having unintended pregnancies, into not having an abortion rather than
18 providing them with comprehensive, fact based reproductive care; and
19 WHEREAS, because these centers are sometimes mistaken for actual clinics providing
20 abortion services, the state's support of their activities puts pregnant populations at greater
21 risk; and
22 WHEREAS, no further taxpayer money should be appropriated to such centers; and
23 WHEREAS, even if Georgians did receive some benefit from such centers, abortion rights
24 are currently restricted in this state beyond six weeks, except in special situations; therefore,
25 there should be less need for such centers; and
26 WHEREAS, consequently, if the number of abortions occurring in this state are decreasing
27 due to that law, the need for any services provided by such centers should also be decreasing;
28 and
29 WHEREAS, the most recent budget appropriated approximately $2 million to fund crisis
30 pregnancy centers; and
31 WHEREAS, this year's budget should provide funding to the Georgia Pregnancy and Early
32 Childhood Home Visiting Program by such amount in lieu of appropriating such moneys to
33 crisis pregnancy centers; and

25 LC 46 1116
34 WHEREAS, this proposal would not cost taxpayers any additional moneys; and
35 WHEREAS, this proposal would better allocate the resources of this state to meet the needs
36 of its residents.
37 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that members of this body
38 urge the General Assembly to appropriate an additional $2 million annually to the Georgia
39 Home Visiting program to improve birth outcomes, reduce preterm deliveries, and decrease
40 infant and maternal mortality rates, in lieu of appropriating such moneys to fund crisis
41 pregnancy centers.
42 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
43 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the General
44 Assembly's legislative leaders.
