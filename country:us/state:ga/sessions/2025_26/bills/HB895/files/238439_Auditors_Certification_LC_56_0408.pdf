SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
House Bill (LC 56 0408)
Dear Representative Martin:
This bill would amend provisions relating to retirement benefits payable to members of the Georgia
Legislative Retirement System. Specifically, this bill would increase the benefits paid to persons who
are active members on January 1, 2026, and for persons who become active members after that date.
If this legislation is enacted, the monthly retirement benefit payable to such members would increase
from $50 per month for each year of creditable service to $75 per month for each year of creditable
service. Members who served as the presiding officer would receive an enhanced benefit of $300 per
month for each year he or she served in that capacity. Currently, the enhancement for retired
members who served as the presiding officer is $200 for each year he or she served in that capacity.
Under the provisions of this bill, any inactive or retired member who, once again, becomes a
contributing member on or after January 1, 2026 would be eligible to receive the increased benefit
for the membership service they earn after January 1, 2026.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems
Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
