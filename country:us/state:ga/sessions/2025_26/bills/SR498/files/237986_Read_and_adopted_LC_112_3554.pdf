Senate Resolution 498
By: Senators Wicks of the 34th and Davenport of the 17th
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing and commending the North Fayette Community Association; and for other
2 purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the North Fayette Community Association (NFCA) was founded in August
4 2001 by local homeowners to address shared issues, interests, and concerns affecting the
5 North Fayette community and was officially chartered as a non-profit, non-partisan
6 organization in October 2001; and
7 WHEREAS, the NFCA was born out of a collective sense of under-representation at the
8 county level and limited access to support, services, resources, and amenities, inspiring
9 residents to organize for change; and
10 WHEREAS, the NFCA has since successfully defended the community from inappropriate
11 developments such as the construction of a service station at the intersection of Highways
12 279 and 314, which would have posed serious challenges to the community; and
13 WHEREAS, in 2009, then-NFCA President Johnnie E. Jones Jr. led a major effort to correct
14 unfair taxation practices that resulted in residents paying taxes to both Clayton and Fulton

18 Highway 138, east of Highway 74, and west of Highway 85, forming a vital region that has
19 grown from 31,256 residents in 2000 to more than three times that number today; and
20 WHEREAS, North Fayette is home to many active and vibrant subdivisions, including
21 Country Lake, Briarfield, Greer Woods, Westbridge I and II, Northridge, Princeton Chase,
22 Providence, Hampstead Heath, Dix-Lee-On, Newton Plantation, and homes along Highways
