365 "(a.1) Any person or his or her authorized agent entitled to the possession of any private
366 property shall have the right to remove or cause to be removed from the property or
367 immobilize or cause to be immobilized any vehicle or trespassing personal property
368 trespassing thereon which is not authorized to be at the place where it is found and to store
369 or cause to be stored such trespassing vehicle or trespassing personal property, provided
370 that there shall have been conspicuously posted on the private property notice that any
371 trespassing vehicle or trespassing personal property which is not authorized to be at the
372 place where it is found may be immobilized or removed at the expense of the owner of the
373 trespassing vehicle or trespassing personal property. Such notice shall also include
374 information as to the contact information for removal of an immobilization device, the full
375 legal names of the company conducting the immobilization and the property owner where
376 the immobilization occurred, the fee amount for removal of an immobilization device,
377 location where the removed vehicle or personal property can be recovered, the cost of said
378 recovery, and information as to the form of payment; provided, however, that the owner
379 of residential private property containing not more than four residential units shall not be
380 required to comply with the posting requirements of this subsection. Only towing and
381 storage firms issued permits or licenses by the local governing authority of the jurisdiction
382 in which they operate or by the department, and having a secure impoundment facility,
- 15 -
25 HB 551/SCSFA
383 shall be permitted to remove trespassing property and trespassing vehicles and personal
384 property at the request of the owner or authorized agent of the private property. Only
385 persons issued a permit by the department and operating in a jurisdiction which has
386 authorized the immobilization of trespassing vehicles by ordinance or resolution of the
387 governing authority shall be authorized to place an immobilization device upon a
388 trespassing vehicle.
389 (b)(1) The department shall have the authorization to regulate and control the
390 immobilization and towing of trespassing vehicles on private property if such
391 immobilization or towing is performed without the prior consent or authorization of the
392 owner or operator of the vehicle, including the authority to set just and reasonable rates,
393 fares, and charges for services related to the immobilization, removal, storage, and
394 required notification to owners of such towed vehicles. No storage fees shall be charged
395 for the first 24 hour period which begins at the time the vehicle is removed from the
396 property, and no such. No fees shall be allowed for the immobilization or removal and
397 storage of vehicles removed by towing and storage firms by persons found to be in
398 violation of this Code section. The department is authorized to impose a civil penalty for
399 any violation of this Code section in an amount not to exceed $2,500.00.
400 (2) In accordance with subsection (d) of this Code section, the governing authority of a
401 municipality may require towing and storage operators firms to charge lower maximum
402 rates on traffic moving between points within such municipality than those provided by
403 the department's maximum rate tariff and may require higher public liability insurance
404 limits and cargo insurance limits than those required by the department. The governing
405 authority of a municipality shall not provide for higher maximum costs of
406 immobilization, removal, relocation, or storage than is provided for by the department."
407 "(f) It shall be unlawful and punishable by a fine of $1,000.00 for any immobilization
408 device operator or towing and storage firm, permitted or unpermitted, licensed or
409 unlicensed, to enter into any agreement with any person in possession of private property
- 16 -
25 HB 551/SCSFA
410 to provide automatic or systematic surveillance of such property for purposes of
411 immobilization or removal and relocation of any such trespassing vehicle or trespassing
412 personal property except upon call by such person in possession of such private property
413 to such immobilization device operator or towing and storage firm for each individual case
414 of trespass; provided, further, that it shall be unlawful and punishable by a fine of
415 $1,000.00 for any towing and storage firm person to pay to any private property owner or
416 one in possession of private property any fee or emolument, directly or indirectly, for the
417 right to immobilize or remove a trespassing vehicle or trespassing personal property from
418 said private property."
419 SECTION 10.
420 Code Section 48-5C-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to alternative ad
421 valorem tax on motor vehicles, is amended by adding a new paragraph to subsection (a), by
422 revising paragraph (9) of subsection (d), and by adding a new subsection to read as follows:
423 "(3.1) 'Passive entity' means a person, other than an individual, formed under the laws
424 of another state that does not have an established place of business in this state, owns no
425 real property, and conducts no trade or business other than the holding of assets for
426 investment and income."
427 "(9)(A) Any owner of any motor vehicle who fails to submit within 30 days of the date
428 such owner is required by law to register such vehicle in this state an application for a
429 first certificate of title under Code Section 40-3-21 or a certificate of title under Code
430 Section 40-3-32 shall be required to pay a penalty in the amount of 10 percent of the
431 state title ad valorem tax fees and 10 percent of the local title ad valorem tax fees
432 required under this Code section and, if such state and local title ad valorem tax fees
433 and the penalty are not paid within 60 days following the date such owner is required
434 by law to register such vehicle, interest at the rate of 1 percent per month shall be
435 imposed on the state and local title ad valorem tax fees due under this Code section,
- 17 -
25 HB 551/SCSFA
436 unless a temporary permit has been issued by the tax commissioner. The tax
437 commissioner shall grant a temporary permit in the event the failure to timely apply for
438 a first certificate of title is due to the failure of a lienholder to comply with Code
439 Section 40-3-56, regarding release of a security interest or lien, and no penalty or
440 interest shall be assessed. Such penalty and interest shall be in addition to the penalty
441 and fee required under Code Section 40-3-21 or 40-3-32, as applicable.
442 (B) The penalties provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be double
443 for any resident of this state who owns at least 50 percent of a passive entity that owns
444 a motor vehicle that fails to submit within 60 days of the date such owner is required
445 by law to register such vehicle in this state an application for a first certificate of title
446 under Code Section 40-3-21 or a certificate of title under Code Section 40-3-32 and
447 register such vehicle."
448 "(h) The commissioner shall be authorized in his or her sole discretion to share information
449 obtained for purposes of this Code section with the board established pursuant to
450 Chapter 47 of Title 43. Any confidential information furnished pursuant to this Code
451 section shall retain its character as confidential. Any person who divulges confidential
452 information obtained pursuant to this Code section shall be subject to the same penalties
453 as those provided for divulgence of information by employees of the department."
454 SECTION 11.
455 This Act shall become effective on January 1, 2026.
456 SECTION 12.
457 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.

24 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
25 SECTION 1.
26 Title 40 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to motor vehicles and traffic, is
27 amended by revising Code Section 40-2-8, relating to operation of unregistered vehicle or
28 vehicle without current license plate, revalidation decal, or county decal and temporary
29 operating permit issued by dealers of new or used motor vehicles, as follows:
30 "40-2-8.
31 (a) No person shall own, rent, lease, or operate any vehicle required to be registered
32 pursuant to Code Section 40-2-20 upon a highway in this state without registering such
33 vehicle. Any person who becomes a resident of this state shall register his or her vehicle
34 within 30 days of becoming a resident. Any person who fails to comply with this
35 subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine of $100.00 for each day
36 in which the vehicle is in violation. Any person owning or operating any vehicle described
37 in Code Section 40-2-20 on any public highway or street without complying with that Code
38 section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, provided that a person shall register his or her
39 motor vehicle within 30 days after becoming a resident of this state. Any person renting,
40 leasing, or loaning any vehicle described in Code Section 40-2-20 which is being used on
41 any public highway or street without complying with that Code section shall be guilty of
42 a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of $100.00 for
- 2 -

25 HB 551/SCSFA
43 each violation; and each day that such vehicle is operated in violation of Code Section
44 40-2-20 shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
45 (b)(1) It shall be unlawful and punishable as for a misdemeanor to operate any vehicle
46 required to be registered in this state pursuant to Code Section 40-2-20 without a valid
47 numbered license plate properly validated with a current revalidation decal, unless such
48 operation is otherwise permitted under this chapter; and provided, further, that the
49 purchaser of a new vehicle or a used vehicle from a dealer of new or used motor vehicles
50 who displays a temporary operating permit issued as provided by paragraph (2) of this
51 subsection Code Section 40-2-8.1 may operate such vehicle on the public highways and
52 streets of this state without a current valid license plate during the period within which
53 the purchaser is required by Code Section authorized by Code Sections 40-2-8.1
54 and 40-2-20. An owner acquiring a motor vehicle from an entity that is not a new or used
55 vehicle dealer shall register such vehicle as provided for in Code Section 40-2-29 unless
56 such vehicle is to be registered under the International Registration Plan pursuant to
57 Article 3A of this chapter.
58 (2)(A) Any dealer of new or used motor vehicles shall issue to the purchaser of a
59 vehicle at the time of sale thereof, unless such vehicle is to be registered under the
60 International Registration Plan, a temporary operating permit as provided for by
61 department rules or regulations which may bear the dealer's name and location and shall
62 bear an expiration date 45 days from the date of purchase. The expiration date of such
63 a temporary operating permit may be revised and extended by the county tag agent
64 upon application by the dealer, the purchaser, or the transferee if an extension of the
65 purchaser's initial registration period has been granted as provided by Code
66 Section 40-2-20. Such temporary operating permit shall not resemble a license plate
67 issued by this state and shall be issued without charge or fee. The requirements of this
68 paragraph shall not apply to a dealer whose primary business is the sale of salvage
69 motor vehicles and other vehicles on which total loss claims have been paid by insurers.
- 3 -

25 HB 551/SCSFA
70 (B) All temporary operating permits issued by dealers to purchasers of vehicles shall
71 be of a standard design prescribed by regulation promulgated by the department. The
72 department may provide by rule or regulation for the sale and distribution of such
73 temporary operating permits by third parties in accordance with paragraph (3) of this
74 subsection.
75 (3) All sellers and distributors of temporary operating permits shall maintain an
76 inventory record of temporary operating permits by number and name of the dealer.
77 (4)(2) The purchaser and operator of a vehicle shall not be subject to the penalties set
78 forth in this Code section during the period allowed for the registration of such vehicle.
79 If the owner of such vehicle presents evidence that such owner has properly applied for
80 the registration of such vehicle, but that the license plate or revalidation decal has not
81 been delivered to such owner, then the owner shall not be subject to the penalties
82 enumerated in this subsection.
83 (c) It shall be unlawful and punishable as for a misdemeanor to operate any vehicle
84 required to be registered in the State of Georgia this state without a valid county decal
85 designating the county where the vehicle was last registered, unless such operation is
86 otherwise permitted under this chapter. Any person convicted of such offense shall be
87 punished by a fine of $25.00 for a first offense and $100.00 for a second or subsequent
88 such offense. However, a A county name decal shall not be required if there is no space
89 provided for a county name decal on the current license plate. Any person convicted of a
90 violation of this subsection shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $25.00 if that person
91 shows to the court having jurisdiction of the offense that the proper revalidation decal had
92 been obtained prior to the time of the offense.
93 (d) No violation of this Code section shall have occurred upon presentation of evidence
94 that the owner had properly applied for the registration of such vehicle, but that the license
95 plate or revalidation decal had not been delivered to such owner at the time the uniform
96 traffic citation was issued.
- 4 -

25 HB 551/SCSFA
97 (e) The commissioner is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to
98 effectuate the provisions of this Code section."
99 SECTION 2.
100 Said title is further amended by revising Code Section 40-2-8.1, relating to operation of
101 vehicle without revalidation decal on license plate, as follows:
102 "40-2-8.1.
103 Notwithstanding Code Section 40-2-8 or any other provision of law, a person who operates
104 a vehicle which is required to be registered in this state and which has attached to the rear
105 thereof a valid numbered license plate without having the required revalidation decal
106 affixed upon that plate, which person is otherwise guilty of a misdemeanor for not having
107 such decal affixed to the plate, shall be subject for that offense only to a fine not to exceed
108 $25.00 if that person shows to the court having jurisdiction of the offense that the proper
109 revalidation decal had been obtained prior to the time of the offense.
110 (a) Any dealer of new or used motor vehicles other than a motor vehicle broker, as such
111 term is defined in Code Section 43-47-2, shall issue a temporary operating permit without
112 charge or fee to the purchaser of a vehicle at the time of sale thereof, unless such vehicle
113 is to be registered under the International Registration Plan or such dealer is one whose
114 primary business is the sale of salvage motor vehicles and other vehicles on which total
115 loss claims have been paid by insurers. Such temporary operating permit shall be of a
116 standard design prescribed the department; provided, however, that such permit shall not
117 resemble a license plate issued by this state. A temporary operating permit may bear the
118 name of the dealer and location and shall include an expiration date which shall be 45 days
119 from the date of purchase. The expiration date of a temporary operating permit may be
120 revised and extended by the county tag agent upon application by the dealer, purchaser, or
121 transferee if an extension of the purchaser's initial registration period has been granted as
122 provided by Code Section 40-2-20.
- 5 -

25 HB 551/SCSFA
123 (b)(1) The department may provide by rule or regulation for the sale and distribution of
124 temporary operating permits to dealers by third parties through the development and
125 maintenance of an electronic temporary operating permit issuance system and establish
126 standards for distribution and issuance of such permits. The department may further
127 provide by rule or regulation for standards for authorized access to an electronic
128 temporary operating permit issuance system, which may include, but shall not be limited
129 to, required criminal background checks for any user of the system. Any third party
130 authorized to sell and distribute temporary operating permits shall maintain an inventory
131 record of such permits by number and name of the dealer.
132 (2)(A) The department shall be authorized to suspend access to the electronic
133 temporary operating permit issuance system established pursuant to this Code section
134 for any dealer found to have issued temporary operating permits for a vehicle which has
135 not been sold or intended to be registered or otherwise violated requirements for
136 issuance of such permits established by rule or regulation of the department after
137 issuance of notice of such violation by electronic means and opportunity for informal
138 review as set forth in this subparagraph. Any dealer who has received notice pursuant
139 to this subsection of an alleged violation and for whom the department intends to
140 suspend access to the electronic temporary operating permit issuance system may
141 request an informal review of the allegations with the department. The method for
142 making such request shall be developed by the department and may be by electronic
143 means. Upon receipt of such request for informal review, the department shall, within
144 ten business days, schedule an informal conference with such dealer to review the
145 suspected violations. Proceedings under this subparagraph shall not be governed by
146 any formal procedural requirements and may be conducted in such manner as the
147 department may establish by rule or regulation. The department shall consider the
148 historical use of the electronic temporary operating permit issuance system by the
149 dealer under consideration for access suspension, together with other pertinent
- 6 -

25 HB 551/SCSFA
150 information which may be available, and shall render a decision regarding access to the
151 electronic temporary operating permit issuance system within seven business days of
152 the informal conference. Upon a finding that such dealer violated the requirements of
153 this Code section or rules and regulations of the department, the department shall be
154 authorized to impose fines or fees as provided by law. The department shall not be
155 authorized to suspend access to the temporary operating permit system unless the
156 department finds a dealer to be substantially out of compliance with the requirements
157 of this Code section or the rules and regulations of the department and such dealer has
158 failed to produce satisfactory evidence of extenuating circumstances to justify such
159 noncompliance.
160 (B) If the department suspends a dealer's access to the electronic temporary operating
161 permit issuance system established pursuant to this Code section after an informal
162 review held pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the suspended dealer shall
163 have the right to a formal hearing to review the suspension pursuant to Code
164 Section 40-3-6. Such hearing shall be held within 30 days of the department's decision
165 to suspend the dealer's access to the electronic temporary operating permit issuance
166 system and shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
167 Administrative Procedure Act.' At such hearing, the department may present evidence
168 of any instances in which the suspended dealer unlawfully issued temporary operating
169 permits or issued fraudulent temporary operating permits. Upon a finding that the
170 suspended dealer is in compliance with the requirements of this Code section and has
171 issued temporary operating permits predominantly for bona fide motor vehicle sales,
172 the department shall provide for the immediate restoration of access to the electronic
173 temporary operating permit issuance system for such dealer but shall be authorized to
174 impose fines or fees as provided by law for failure to comply with the requirements of
175 this chapter. Upon a finding that the suspended dealer violated the requirements of this
176 Code section or rules and regulations of the department, the department shall be
- 7 -

25 HB 551/SCSFA
177 authorized to extend the term of suspension for a period of up to 24 months. Upon a
178 finding that a dealer has unlawfully issued temporary operating permits in violation of
179 this chapter or rules and regulations of the department, the department shall further be
180 authorized to issue a civil monetary penalty in an amount no greater than $100.00 per
181 violation, suspend or revoke the registration issued to a dealer pursuant to Code Section
182 40-2-39, and suspend, confiscate, or limit issuance of any dealer plates issued pursuant
183 to Code Section 40-2-38 for a period of up to 24 months. The department shall comply
184 with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act,' in relation to
185 the expedited review provided for in this subparagraph and the suspended dealer shall
186 have the right to appeal any decision of the department in accordance with such chapter.
187 (c) The commissioner is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to
188 effectuate the provisions of this Code section."
189 SECTION 3.
190 Said title is further amended in Code Section 40-2-33, relating to issuance of license plates
191 and decals, transfer of registration to a digital license plate, compensation of tag agents, and
192 required identification, by revising paragraph (3) of subsection (a) as follows:
193 "(3) At the time of initial application for registration or at any time during the registration
194 period, a vehicle owner may file with the county tag agent, on a form or electronic form
195 prescribed by the commissioner, a request to have a vehicle license plate duplicated on
196 a digital license plate purchased from a digital license plate provider. Such request to the
197 county tag agent shall include all applicable registration fees. Upon approving the
198 application provided in this paragraph, the commissioner or county tag agent shall furnish
199 the digital license plate provider with the appropriate licensing information to be
200 displayed upon the digital license plate. In accordance with Code Section 40-2-8
201 40-2-8.1, a 45 day temporary operating permit shall be issued by the commissioner or
- 8 -

25 HB 551/SCSFA
202 county tag agent to an applicant for a digital license plate until such license plate is
