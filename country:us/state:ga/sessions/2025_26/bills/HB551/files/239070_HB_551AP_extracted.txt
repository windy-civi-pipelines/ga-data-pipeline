437 "(9)(A) Any owner of any motor vehicle who fails to submit within 30 days of the date
438 such owner is required by law to register such vehicle in this state an application for a
439 first certificate of title under Code Section 40-3-21 or a certificate of title under Code
440 Section 40-3-32 shall be required to pay a penalty in the amount of 10 percent of the
H. B. 551
- 17 -
25 HB 551/AP
441 state title ad valorem tax fees and 10 percent of the local title ad valorem tax fees
442 required under this Code section and, if such state and local title ad valorem tax fees
443 and the penalty are not paid within 60 days following the date such owner is required
444 by law to register such vehicle, interest at the rate of 1 percent per month shall be
445 imposed on the state and local title ad valorem tax fees due under this Code section,
446 unless a temporary permit has been issued by the tax commissioner. The tax
447 commissioner shall grant a temporary permit in the event the failure to timely apply for
448 a first certificate of title is due to the failure of a lienholder to comply with Code
449 Section 40-3-56, regarding release of a security interest or lien, and no penalty or
450 interest shall be assessed. Such penalty and interest shall be in addition to the penalty
451 and fee required under Code Section 40-3-21 or 40-3-32, as applicable.
452 (B) The penalties provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be double
453 for any resident of this state who owns at least 50 percent of a passive entity that owns
454 a motor vehicle that fails to submit within 60 days of the date such owner is required
455 by law to register such vehicle in this state an application for a first certificate of title
456 under Code Section 40-3-21 or a certificate of title under Code Section 40-3-32 and
457 register such vehicle."
458 "(h) The commissioner shall be authorized in his or her sole discretion to share information
459 obtained for purposes of this Code section with the board established pursuant to
460 Chapter 47 of Title 43. Any confidential information furnished pursuant to this Code
461 section shall retain its character as confidential. Any person who divulges confidential
462 information obtained pursuant to this Code section shall be subject to the same penalties
463 as those provided for divulgence of information by employees of the department."

29 vehicle without current license plate, revalidation decal, or county decal and temporary

31 "40-2-8.
32 (a) No person shall own, rent, lease, or operate any vehicle required to be registered
33 pursuant to Code Section 40-2-20 upon a highway in this state without registering such
34 vehicle. Any person who becomes a resident of this state shall register his or her vehicle
35 within 30 days of becoming a resident. Any person who fails to comply with this
36 subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine of $100.00 for each day
37 in which the vehicle is in violation. Any person owning or operating any vehicle described
38 in Code Section 40-2-20 on any public highway or street without complying with that Code
39 section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, provided that a person shall register his or her
40 motor vehicle within 30 days after becoming a resident of this state. Any person renting,
41 leasing, or loaning any vehicle described in Code Section 40-2-20 which is being used on

H. B. 551
- 2 -

25 HB 551/AP
44 each violation; and each day that such vehicle is operated in violation of Code Section
45 40-2-20 shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
46 (b)(1) It shall be unlawful and punishable as for a misdemeanor to operate any vehicle
47 required to be registered in this state pursuant to Code Section 40-2-20 without a valid
48 numbered license plate properly validated with a current revalidation decal, unless such
49 operation is otherwise permitted under this chapter; and provided, further, that the
50 purchaser of a new vehicle or a used vehicle from a dealer of new or used motor vehicles
51 who displays a temporary operating permit issued as provided by paragraph (2) of this
52 subsection Code Section 40-2-8.1 may operate such vehicle on the public highways and
53 streets of this state without a current valid license plate during the period within which
54 the purchaser is required by Code Section authorized by Code Sections 40-2-8.1
55 and 40-2-20. An owner acquiring a motor vehicle from an entity that is not a new or used

67 Section 40-2-20. Such temporary operating permit shall not resemble a license plate
68 issued by this state and shall be issued without charge or fee. The requirements of this

70 motor vehicles and other vehicles on which total loss claims have been paid by insurers.
H. B. 551
- 3 -

25 HB 551/AP
71 (B) All temporary operating permits issued by dealers to purchasers of vehicles shall
72 be of a standard design prescribed by regulation promulgated by the department. The

81 the registration of such vehicle, but that the license plate or revalidation decal has not
82 been delivered to such owner, then the owner shall not be subject to the penalties
83 enumerated in this subsection.
84 (c) It shall be unlawful and punishable as for a misdemeanor to operate any vehicle
85 required to be registered in the State of Georgia this state without a valid county decal
86 designating the county where the vehicle was last registered, unless such operation is
87 otherwise permitted under this chapter. Any person convicted of such offense shall be
88 punished by a fine of $25.00 for a first offense and $100.00 for a second or subsequent
89 such offense. However, a A county name decal shall not be required if there is no space
90 provided for a county name decal on the current license plate. Any person convicted of a
91 violation of this subsection shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $25.00 if that person
92 shows to the court having jurisdiction of the offense that the proper revalidation decal had
93 been obtained prior to the time of the offense.
94 (d) No violation of this Code section shall have occurred upon presentation of evidence
95 that the owner had properly applied for the registration of such vehicle, but that the license
96 plate or revalidation decal had not been delivered to such owner at the time the uniform
97 traffic citation was issued.

105 a vehicle which is required to be registered in this state and which has attached to the rear
106 thereof a valid numbered license plate without having the required revalidation decal
107 affixed upon that plate, which person is otherwise guilty of a misdemeanor for not having
108 such decal affixed to the plate, shall be subject for that offense only to a fine not to exceed
109 $25.00 if that person shows to the court having jurisdiction of the offense that the proper
110 revalidation decal had been obtained prior to the time of the offense.
111 (a) As used in this Code section, the term 'dealer' means any person who is engaged, in
112 whole or in part, in the business of selling, exchanging, renting with an option to purchase,

121 whose primary business is the sale of salvage motor vehicles and other vehicles on which
122 total loss claims have been paid by insurers. Such temporary operating permit shall be of
123 a standard design prescribed the department; provided, however, that such permit shall not

- 5 -

25 HB 551/AP
124 resemble a license plate issued by this state. A temporary operating permit may bear the
125 name of the dealer and location and shall include an expiration date which shall be 45 days
126 from the date of purchase. The expiration date of a temporary operating permit may be
127 revised and extended by the county tag agent upon application by the dealer, purchaser, or

138 record of such permits by number and name of the dealer.
139 (2)(A) The department shall be authorized to suspend access to the electronic

143 issuance of such permits established by rule or regulation of the department after
144 issuance of notice of such violation by electronic means and opportunity for informal
145 review as set forth in this subparagraph. Any dealer who has received notice pursuant
146 to this subsection of an alleged violation and for whom the department intends to
147 suspend access to the electronic temporary operating permit issuance system may
148 request an informal review of the allegations with the department. The method for
149 making such request shall be developed by the department and may be by electronic
150 means. Upon receipt of such request for informal review, the department shall, within
H. B. 551
- 6 -

25 HB 551/AP
151 ten business days, schedule an informal conference with such dealer to review the
152 suspected violations. Proceedings under this subparagraph shall not be governed by
153 any formal procedural requirements and may be conducted in such manner as the
154 department may establish by rule or regulation. The department shall consider the
155 historical use of the electronic temporary operating permit issuance system by the
156 dealer under consideration for access suspension, together with other pertinent
157 information which may be available, and shall render a decision regarding access to the
158 electronic temporary operating permit issuance system within seven business days of
159 the informal conference. Upon a finding that such dealer violated the requirements of
160 this Code section or rules and regulations of the department, the department shall be
161 authorized to impose fines or fees as provided by law. The department shall not be
162 authorized to suspend access to the temporary operating permit system unless the
163 department finds a dealer to be substantially out of compliance with the requirements
164 of this Code section or the rules and regulations of the department and such dealer has
165 failed to produce satisfactory evidence of extenuating circumstances to justify such
166 noncompliance.
167 (B) If the department suspends a dealer's access to the electronic temporary operating
168 permit issuance system established pursuant to this Code section after an informal
169 review held pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the suspended dealer shall
170 have the right to a formal hearing to review the suspension pursuant to Code
171 Section 40-3-6. Such hearing shall be held within 30 days of the department's decision
172 to suspend the dealer's access to the electronic temporary operating permit issuance
173 system and shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
174 Administrative Procedure Act.' At such hearing, the department may present evidence
175 of any instances in which the suspended dealer unlawfully issued temporary operating
176 permits or issued fraudulent temporary operating permits. Upon a finding that the
177 suspended dealer is in compliance with the requirements of this Code section and has
H. B. 551
- 7 -

25 HB 551/AP
178 issued temporary operating permits predominantly for bona fide motor vehicle sales,
179 the department shall provide for the immediate restoration of access to the electronic
180 temporary operating permit issuance system for such dealer but shall be authorized to
181 impose fines or fees as provided by law for failure to comply with the requirements of
182 this chapter. Upon a finding that the suspended dealer violated the requirements of this
183 Code section or rules and regulations of the department, the department shall be
184 authorized to extend the term of suspension for a period of up to 24 months. Upon a
185 finding that a dealer has unlawfully issued temporary operating permits in violation of
186 this chapter or rules and regulations of the department, the department shall further be
187 authorized to issue a civil monetary penalty in an amount no greater than $100.00 per
188 violation, suspend or revoke the registration issued to a dealer pursuant to Code Section
189 40-2-39, and suspend, confiscate, or limit issuance of any dealer plates issued pursuant
190 to Code Section 40-2-38 for a period of up to 24 months. The department shall comply
191 with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act,' in relation to
192 the expedited review provided for in this subparagraph and the suspended dealer shall
193 have the right to appeal any decision of the department in accordance with such chapter.
194 (d) The commissioner is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to
195 effectuate the provisions of this Code section."
196 SECTION 3.
197 Said title is further amended in Code Section 40-2-33, relating to issuance of license plates
198 and decals, transfer of registration to a digital license plate, compensation of tag agents, and
199 required identification, by revising paragraph (3) of subsection (a) as follows:

201 period, a vehicle owner may file with the county tag agent, on a form or electronic form
202 prescribed by the commissioner, a request to have a vehicle license plate duplicated on
203 a digital license plate purchased from a digital license plate provider. Such request to the
H. B. 551

204 county tag agent shall include all applicable registration fees. Upon approving the
205 application provided in this paragraph, the commissioner or county tag agent shall furnish
206 the digital license plate provider with the appropriate licensing information to be
207 displayed upon the digital license plate. In accordance with Code Section 40-2-8
208 40-2-8.1, a 45 day temporary operating permit shall be issued by the commissioner or
209 county tag agent to an applicant for a digital license plate until such license plate is
210 received by the applicant."
211 SECTION 4.
212 Said title is further amended in Code Section 40-2-38, relating to registration and licensing
213 of manufacturers, distributors, and dealers and issuance of manufacturer, manufacturer
