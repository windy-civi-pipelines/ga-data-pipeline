360 "(9)(A) Any owner of any motor vehicle who fails to submit within 30 days of the date
361 such owner is required by law to register such vehicle in this state an application for a
362 first certificate of title under Code Section 40-3-21 or a certificate of title under Code
363 Section 40-3-32 shall be required to pay a penalty in the amount of 10 percent of the
364 state title ad valorem tax fees and 10 percent of the local title ad valorem tax fees
365 required under this Code section and, if such state and local title ad valorem tax fees
366 and the penalty are not paid within 60 days following the date such owner is required
367 by law to register such vehicle, interest at the rate of 1 percent per month shall be
368 imposed on the state and local title ad valorem tax fees due under this Code section,
369 unless a temporary permit has been issued by the tax commissioner. The tax

372 Section 40-3-56, regarding release of a security interest or lien, and no penalty or
373 interest shall be assessed. Such penalty and interest shall be in addition to the penalty
374 and fee required under Code Section 40-3-21 or 40-3-32, as applicable.
375 (B) The penalties provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be double
376 for any resident of this state who owns at least 50 percent of a passive entity that owns
377 a motor vehicle that fails to submit within 60 days of the date such owner is required
