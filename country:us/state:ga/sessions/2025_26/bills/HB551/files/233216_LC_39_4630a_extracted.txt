133 issuance of such permits established by rule or regulation of the department after

147 information which may be available, and shall render a decision regarding access to the
148 electronic temporary operating permit issuance system within seven business days of
149 the informal conference. Upon a finding that such dealer violated the requirements of

153 department finds a dealer to be substantially out of compliance with the requirements
154 of this Code section or the rules and regulations of the department and such dealer has
155 failed to produce satisfactory evidence of extenuating circumstances to justify such
156 noncompliance.
157 (B) If the department suspends a dealer's access to the electronic temporary operating
158 permit issuance system established pursuant to this Code section after an informal
159 review held pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the suspended dealer shall
160 have the right to a formal hearing to review the suspension pursuant to Code Section

163 system and shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
164 Administrative Procedure Act.' At such hearing, the department may present evidence
165 of any instances in which the suspended dealer unlawfully issued temporary operating

44 required to be registered in this state pursuant to Code Section 40-2-20 without a valid
45 numbered license plate properly validated with a current revalidation decal, unless such
46 operation is otherwise permitted under this chapter; and provided, further, that the
47 purchaser of a new vehicle or a used vehicle from a dealer of new or used motor vehicles
48 who displays a temporary operating permit issued as provided by paragraph (2) of this
49 subsection Code Section 40-2-8.1 may operate such vehicle on the public highways and

79 been delivered to such owner, then the owner shall not be subject to the penalties
80 enumerated in this subsection.
81 (c) It shall be unlawful and punishable as for a misdemeanor to operate any vehicle
82 required to be registered in the State of Georgia this state without a valid county decal

98 Said title is further amended by revising Code Section 40-2-8.1, relating to operation of
99 vehicle without revalidation decal on license plate, as follows:

104 affixed upon that plate, which person is otherwise guilty of a misdemeanor for not having
105 such decal affixed to the plate, shall be subject for that offense only to a fine not to exceed
106 $25.00 if that person shows to the court having jurisdiction of the offense that the proper
107 revalidation decal had been obtained prior to the time of the offense.

146 dealer under consideration for access suspension, together with other pertinent
147 information which may be available, and shall render a decision regarding access to the
148 electronic temporary operating permit issuance system within seven business days of
149 the informal conference. Upon a finding that such dealer violated the requirements of

153 department finds a dealer to be substantially out of compliance with the requirements
154 of this Code section or the rules and regulations of the department and such dealer has
155 failed to produce satisfactory evidence of extenuating circumstances to justify such
156 noncompliance.
157 (B) If the department suspends a dealer's access to the electronic temporary operating
158 permit issuance system established pursuant to this Code section after an informal
159 review held pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the suspended dealer shall
160 have the right to a formal hearing to review the suspension pursuant to Code Section
161 40-3-6. Such hearing shall be held within 30 days of the department's decision to
162 suspend the dealer's access to the electronic termporary operating permit issuance
163 system and shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
164 Administrative Procedure Act.' At such hearing, the department may present evidence
165 of any instances in which the suspended dealer unlawfully issued temporary operating
166 permits or issued fraudulent temporary operating permits. Upon a finding that the

168 issued temporary operating permits predominantly for bona fide motor vehicle sales,
169 the department shall provide for the immediate restoration of access to the electronic
170 temporary operating permit issuance system for such dealer but shall be authorized to
171 impose fines or fees as provided by law for failure to comply with the requirements of
172 this chapter. Upon a finding that the suspended dealer violated the requirements of this

334 Section 40-3-32, obtain a certificate of title in such dealer's name prior to selling or
335 otherwise transferring said vehicle to any other person or dealer.
336 (b) Every dealer shall maintain a record, in the form the commissioner prescribes, of every
337 vehicle bought, sold, or exchanged by him, or received by him for sale or exchange. Such
338 record shall be kept for three years and shall be open to inspection by a representative of
339 the commissioner during reasonable business hours. The information contained in records
340 maintained by a dealer pursuant to this subsection shall be an accurate representation of the
341 transaction, and no alternative versions of records shall be produced for a purchaser with
342 information which differs from that contained in records maintained for inspection by the
343 department."
344 "(f) The department shall be authorized to assess a civil penalty against a dealer of up to
345 $500.00 for each sales transaction conducted in violation of subsection (b) of this Code
346 section.

353 suspension for conviction or false statement, and meetings, is amended by revising
354 subsection (b) as follows:
355 "(b) A division under this chapter shall not issue or renew any license unless the applicant

358 vehicle broker shall demonstrate that such established place of business has five or more
359 used motor vehicles on display for purchase or exchange."
360 SECTION 10.
361 Code Section 48-5C-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to alternative ad
362 valorem tax on motor vehicles, is amended by adding a new paragraph to subsection (a), by
363 revising paragraph (9) of subsection (d), and by adding a new subsection to read as follows:
364 "(3.1) 'Passive entity' means a person, other than an individual, formed under the laws
365 of another state that does not have an established place of business in this state, owns no
366 real property, and conducts no trade or business other than the holding of assets for
367 investment and income."
368 "(9)(A) Any owner of any motor vehicle who fails to submit within 30 days of the date
369 such owner is required by law to register such vehicle in this state an application for a
370 first certificate of title under Code Section 40-3-21 or a certificate of title under Code
371 Section 40-3-32 shall be required to pay a penalty in the amount of 10 percent of the
372 state title ad valorem tax fees and 10 percent of the local title ad valorem tax fees
373 required under this Code section and, if such state and local title ad valorem tax fees
374 and the penalty are not paid within 60 days following the date such owner is required
375 by law to register such vehicle, interest at the rate of 1 percent per month shall be
376 imposed on the state and local title ad valorem tax fees due under this Code section,
377 unless a temporary permit has been issued by the tax commissioner. The tax
378 commissioner shall grant a temporary permit in the event the failure to timely apply for
379 a first certificate of title is due to the failure of a lienholder to comply with Code
380 Section 40-3-56, regarding release of a security interest or lien, and no penalty or
381 interest shall be assessed. Such penalty and interest shall be in addition to the penalty
382 and fee required under Code Section 40-3-21 or 40-3-32, as applicable.

386 by law to register such vehicle in this state an application for a first certificate of title
387 under Code Section 40-3-21 or a certificate of title under Code Section 40-3-32 and

389 "(h) The commissioner shall be authorized in his or her sole discretion to share information
390 obtained for purposes of this Code section with the board established pursuant to
391 Chapter 47 of Title 43. Any confidential information furnished pursuant to this Code
392 section shall retain its character as confidential. Any person who divulges confidential
393 information obtained pursuant to this Code section shall be subject to the same penalties
394 as those provided for divulgence of information by employees of the department."
