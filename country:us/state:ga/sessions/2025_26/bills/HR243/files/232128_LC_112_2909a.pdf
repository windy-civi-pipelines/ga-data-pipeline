25 LC 112 2909
14 WHEREAS, purebred dogs are working dogs, serving as avalanche dogs, trackers and
15 trailers, herders, controllers of vermin, water rescuers, carting and sled dogs, retrievers,
16 protectors, hunters, and bird dogs, and they are always the heartbeat of a companion near and
17 dear to humans; and
18 WHEREAS, all dogs should be valued regardless of their ancestry, but the purpose-bred dog
19 and the predictability of its breed should be cherished and preserved; and
20 WHEREAS, each breed is incredibly etched in the history of the culture that created it, just
21 as surely as that culture's music, art, and language, making it abundantly fitting that we
22 recognize purebred dogs.
23 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
24 the members of this body commend the benefits and contributions of purebred dogs and
25 recognize May 1, 2025, as Purebred Dog Day at the state capitol.
26 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
27 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
28 public and the press.
