18 by the various tax jurisdictions authorized to impose an ad valorem tax on property as
19 provided in Code Section 48-5-473; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall

26 Motor vehicles owned by a natural person for which a title was issued in this state before

33 returned for ad valorem taxation, shall not be taxed, and no taxes shall be collected on such
34 motor vehicles."
