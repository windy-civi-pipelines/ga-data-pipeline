12 to subsection (b) to read as follows:

16 Board of Education. Instructional materials that include the use of the three-cueing
17 system shall not constitute high-quality instructional materials."
18 "(8) 'Structured literacy' means an evidence based approach to teaching oral and written
19 language aligned to the science of reading founded on the science of how children learn
20 to read and characterized by explicit, systematic, cumulative, and diagnostic instruction
21 in phonology, sound-symbol association, syllable instruction, morphology, syntax, and
22 semantics. An approach to teaching oral and written language that features or promotes
23 the three-cueing system shall not constitute structured literacy.
24 (8.1) 'Three-cueing system' means any model of teaching students to read based on
25 meaning, structure and syntax, and visual cues. Such model or method may also be
26 referred to as MSV."

30 "(6) Except as expressly agreed to by the parent or guardian of a nonverbal student as
31 part of such student's Individualized Education Program, instruction in public schools and
32 local school systems shall not employ the three-cueing system or visual memory as a
33 basis for teaching word reading. Instruction may include visual information and
34 strategies which improve background and experiential knowledge, add context, and
35 increase oral language and vocabulary to support comprehension, but shall not be used
36 to teach word reading."

48 comprehension; and
49 (C) Employ multisensory and multimodal intervention strategies;
50 (3) Content literacy and mathematics practices;
51 (4) Strategies appropriate for the instruction of English language learners;
