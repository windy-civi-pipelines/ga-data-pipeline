16 Board of Education. Instructional materials that include the use of the three-cuing system
17 shall not constitute high-quality instructional materials."
18 "(8) 'Structured literacy' means an evidence based approach to teaching oral and written
19 language aligned to the science of reading founded on the science of how children learn
20 to read and characterized by explicit, systematic, cumulative, and diagnostic instruction
21 in phonology, sound-symbol association, syllable instruction, morphology, syntax, and
22 semantics. An approach to teaching oral and written language that features or promotes
23 the three-cuing system shall not constitute structured literacy.

30 "(6) Instruction in public schools and local school systems shall not employ the
31 three-cueing system or visual memory as a basis for teaching word reading. Instruction
32 may include visual information and strategies which improve background and
33 experiential knowledge, add context, and increase oral language and vocabulary to
34 support comprehension, but shall not be used to teach word reading."
