25 LC 44 2876
17 provided, however, that such unused portion must be minimally managed so that it does
18 not contribute significantly to erosion or other environmental or conservation problems.
19 The lease of hunting rights or the use of the property for hunting purposes shall not
20 constitute another type of business. The charging of admission for use of the property for
21 fishing purposes shall not constitute another type of business;
22 (2)(A)(i) The owner of a tract, lot, or parcel of land totaling less than ten acres shall
23 be required by the tax assessor to submit additional relevant records regarding proof
24 of bona fide conservation use for qualified property that on or after May 1, 2012, is
25 either first made subject to a covenant or is subject to a renewal of a previous
26 covenant. The provisions of this paragraph relating to requiring additional relevant
27 records regarding proof of bona fide conservation use shall not apply to such property
28 if the owner of the subject property provides one or more of the following:
29 (i)(I) Proof that such owner has filed with the Internal Revenue Service a
30 Schedule E, reporting farm related income or loss, or a Schedule F, with Form 1040,
31 or, if applicable, a Form 4835, pertaining to such property;
32 (ii)(II) Proof that such owner has incurred expenses for the qualifying use; or
33 (iii)(III) Proof that such owner has generated income from the qualifying use.
34 (ii) Prior to a denial of eligibility under this paragraph, the tax assessor shall conduct

36 shall be provided to the property owner before being allowed a visual, on-site
37 inspection of the property by the tax assessor.
38 (B) The owner of a tract, lot, or parcel of land totaling ten acres or more shall not be
39 required by the tax assessor to submit additional relevant records regarding proof of
40 bona fide conservation use for qualified property that on or after May 1, 2012, is either
41 first made subject to a covenant or is subject to a renewal of a previous covenant;

25 LC 44 2876
42 (3) No property shall qualify as bona fide conservation use property if such current use
43 assessment would result in any person who has a beneficial interest in such property,
44 including any interest in the nature of stock ownership, receiving in any tax year any
45 benefit of current use assessment as to more than 2,000 acres. If any taxpayer has any
46 beneficial interest in more than 2,000 acres of tangible real property which is devoted to
47 bona fide conservation uses, such taxpayer shall apply for current use assessment only
48 as to 2,000 acres of such land;
49 (4) No property shall qualify as bona fide conservation use property if it is leased to a
50 person or entity which would not be entitled to conservation use assessment;. This
51 paragraph shall not apply to a corporation, a partnership, a general partnership, a limited
52 partnership, a limited corporation, or a limited liability company registered with the
53 Secretary of State that meets the following conditions:
54 (A)(i) Its ownership includes only natural or naturalized citizens;
55 (ii) It has as its primary purpose the production of agricultural products or timber
56 from or on the land, including, but not limited to, subsistence farming or commercial
57 production; and
58 (iii) It derives 80 percent or more of its gross income from bona fide conservation
59 uses, including earnings on investments directly related to past or future bona fide
60 conservation uses, within this state; or
61 (B) At least one of its members has no less than a 25 percent ownership interest in the
62 property being leased and would be entitled to conservation use assessment;
63 (5) No property shall qualify as bona fide conservation use property if such property is
64 at the time of application for current use assessment subject to a restrictive covenant
65 which prohibits the use of the property for the specific purpose described in
66 subparagraph (a)(1)(E) of this Code section for which bona fide conservation use
67 qualification is sought; and
H. B. 129

25 LC 44 2876
68 (6) No otherwise qualified property shall be denied current use assessment on the
69 grounds that no soil map is available for the county in which such property is located;
70 provided, however, that, if no soil map is available for the county in which such property
71 is located, the owner making an application for current use assessment shall provide the
72 board of tax assessors with a certified soil survey of the subject property unless another
73 method for determining the soil type of the subject property is authorized in writing by
74 such board."
