SUBJECT: Fiscal Note
House Bill (LC 61 0012)
Dear Representative Bell,
The bill would repeal the Drug-Free Postsecondary Education Act of 1990 that makes students
convicted of certain drug offenses ineligible for loans, scholarships, and grants. The bill provides
that students shall not be deemed ineligible for HOPE scholarships or grants based solely on certain
convictions, specifically an offense involving marijuana or a controlled substance.
HOPE Scholarships and Grants are available to qualifying students who attend the University
System of Georgia (USG), the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG), and HOPE-eligible
private postsecondary institutions. USG said that institutions already have established rules and
regulations consistent with local, state and federal law concerning drug use, manufacture,
distribution, sale, and possession on campus. They do not believe that the bill would change
institutions' policies on students faced with drug convictions. TCSG also said that their campuses
have rules and regulations regarding drugs on campus and do not anticipate the bill changing the
policies.
While we are unable to provide an exact estimate of how many students would receive HOPE as a
result of the bill, it would likely be a relatively small number. The Georgia Student Finance .
Commission does not have data on the number of potentially impacted students. TCSG and USG
also do not track the number of students denied the HOPE Grant or HOPE Scholarship on this
basis. USG did report that they believe there to have been minimal instances of students being
denied, citing an example of one institution with two instances of HOPE denial due to a self
reported drug conviction in 25 years. The number of students who did not apply for HOPE because
they knew they were ineligible is unknown.
Table 1 provides the annual cost of HOPE for a small number of students. Our estimate that only a
small number of students would be impacted in based on the USG statement and information
related to drug convictions of juveniles discussed below. The amount per student is based on
average award amounts across all USG institutions.

• According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2023 there were about 1.5 million Georgians
between the ages of 10-19.
• The Georgia Bureau of Investigation's 2023 Crime Statistics Summary reported that 576
juveniles were arrested for possession of marijuana in 2023 and five were arrested for sale of
marijuana. This represents roughly 0.04% of the juvenile population. Another 221 juvenile
arrests for possession of other substances, and 103 arrests for sales of other substances.
These represent approximately 0.02% of the population.
• Individuals with a conviction would no longer be ineligible under this bill, but they would
still need to meet other HOPE requirements for the funding.
Respectfully,
