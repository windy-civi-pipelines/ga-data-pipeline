21 Action Fund; and
22 WHEREAS, it is reported that Rick Thompson, the vice chairman of the State Ethics

37 WHEREAS, such inquiry is necessary to determine whether Georgia laws related to

40 state enforcement and oversight of such activities; and
41 WHEREAS, such inquiry is necessary to determine if any link exists between organizations
42 receiving federal funds and political activities occurring within the State of Georgia such as
43 the alleged and admitted conduct by multiple organizations associated with Stacey Abrams
44 and whether additional state law or enforcement tools are necessary to address such illegal
45 coordination and misuse of public funds; and
46 WHEREAS, the General Assembly, of which the Senate is a part, has "the power to make
47 all laws not inconsistent with this Constitution, and not repugnant to the Constitution of the
48 United States, which it shall deem necessary and proper for the welfare of the state"; see Ga.
49 Const. Art. III, Sec. VI, Para. I; and
50 WHEREAS, the General Assembly is further specifically empowered by the Constitution of
51 the State of Georgia to pass legislation regarding the conducting of elections, see Ga. Const.

60 (Ga. Super. Dec. 23, 2024); and
61 WHEREAS, the Superior Court in Willis agreed and acknowledged that precedent maintains
62 that the "inherent powers of our State General Assembly are awesome … The legislature is
63 absolutely unrestricted in its power to legislate, so long as it does not undertake to enact
64 measures prohibited by the State or Federal Constitution," Willis at 2 (citing Ga. Power Co.
65 v. Allied Chem. Corp., 233 Ga. 558, 565 (citing Sears v. State of Georgia, 232 Ga. 547,
66 553-54)); and
67 WHEREAS, the Willis court further recognized that the "State Constitution authorizes each
68 chamber to adopt its own rules and create committees … Here, the Senate, as a chamber,
69 empowered itself to issue subpoenas, which it was authorized to do," Willis at 3 (citing Ga.
70 Const. Art. III, Sec. IV, Par. IV; Coggin v. Davey, 233 Ga. 407, 411); and
71 WHEREAS, such inherent powers also include the authority to create special committees for
72 the purpose of conducting investigations and to endow such committees with all the inherent
73 powers of investigation possessed by the Senate, including the power to compel the
74 appearance and testimony of witnesses and the production of records and the power to place
75 witnesses under oath or affirmation; and
76 WHEREAS, in addition to such inherent powers, Code Sections 45-15-17 and 45-15-19
77 empower the General Assembly to make investigations into the affairs of the state and further
78 authorize compelling the appearance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
79 records and grants, the power to place witnesses under oath or affirmation, and to enforce
80 subpoenas issued pursuant thereto; and

93 Investigations to issue subpoenas for witnesses or to compel the production of books,
94 records, or papers, and authorized such committee to take such actions as it deems necessary;
95 and
96 WHEREAS, in the exercise of the aforesaid powers, it is necessary to determine whether the
97 conduct of various organizations associated with Stacey Abrams should be addressed by the
98 enactment of new or amended laws of state-wide application, prompt some change in state
99 enforcement of campaign finance and ethics laws, or both; and
100 WHEREAS, it is the sense of the Senate that such issues arising from or relating to the
101 alleged and admitted conduct of various organizations associated with Stacey Abrams are
