17 to the subject matter involved in the investigation, proceeding, or petition before the
18 commission, in the same manner prescribed in Chapter 11 of Title 9 for discovery in civil
19 actions. In any case involving an application of a gas company to establish just and
20 reasonable rates pursuant to Code Section 46-2-23.1 or 46-4-154 proceeding before the
21 commission, all parties to the particular proceeding, including intervenors who are granted
22 party status pursuant to Code Section 46-2-59, as well as the gas company subject to the
23 particular proceeding, shall have all discovery rights available under Chapter 11 of Title 9.
24 (b) The commission, its agents and employees as directed by the commission, and all
25 parties to a proceeding before the commission, including intervenors and gas companies,
26 which are granted discovery rights under subsection (a) of this Code section are authorized
27 to petition the Superior Court of Fulton County for all orders, injunctions, and subpoenas
28 necessary to carry out the provisions of this Code section which would otherwise be
29 authorized or necessary under Chapter 11 of Title 9; and the judges and clerks of the court
30 are authorized to issue all such orders, injunctions, and subpoenas and to take all other
31 actions necessary to carry out this Code section which would otherwise be authorized or
32 necessary under Chapter 11 of Title 9.
33 (c) In addition to the sanctions which may be imposed under Code Section 9-11-37, the
34 Superior Court of Fulton County is further authorized to extend the period of suspension
35 of the operation of any new schedules and defer the use of such rates, charges,
36 classifications, or service beyond the time authorized by Code Section 46-2-25, if the court,
37 upon application of the commission, determines that the failure of any regulated utility to
38 comply with a discovery request of the commission, its agents, or its employees is
39 unreasonable and requires such extension. No such extension of the period of suspension
40 shall be considered by the court unless the utility has failed completely to respond to a
41 valid deposition or discovery request.
42 (d) Any application or petition made by the commission, its agents, or its employees
43 pursuant to subsection (b) of this Code section shall be heard within 20 days of the filing

45 petition has previously been made, and shall be disposed of promptly."
