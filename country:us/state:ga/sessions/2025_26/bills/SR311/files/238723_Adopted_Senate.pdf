ADOPTED SENATE
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the Senate Study Committee on Recovery Residences; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, recovery residences provide sober housing to people in recovery and are
3 generally understood to be supportive living residential environments where life skills vital
4 for sustaining recovery from addiction are learned and practiced in a safe home-like setting;
5 and
6 WHEREAS, while recovery residences provide a useful service, there are concerns that,
7 because of the lack of oversight, some of these facilities could prioritize financial gain over
8 resident safety, costing individuals and families unnecessary expenses or providing unsafe
9 environments that could lead to injury or death; and
10 WHEREAS, recovery residences do not provide treatment, are not regulated, and are not
11 registered with the state; and
12 WHEREAS, there are an estimated 256 recovery residences located in Georgia, with the
13 actual number and quality of such residences unknown; and
