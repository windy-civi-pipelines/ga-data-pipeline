40 of the date of submission, the association and those mortgagees permitted to vote on
41 amendments vote to retain the requirements by a majority and, if no such vote occurs,

42 those provisions requiring more than 80 percent of the voting interest shall be deemed to
43 only require 80 percent of the voting interest.
44 (3) This subsection shall not be deemed to eliminate or modify any right of the declarant
45 provided for in the instrument to approve amendments to the instrument so long as the

55 association in which membership is mandatory for all owners of lots in the development,
56 which declaration is amended in accordance with Code Section 44-3-222 in order to
57 submit the property owners' association to this article; provided, however, that any
58 amendment must conform the instrument creating the property owners' association to this
59 article, and the property owners' development shall thereafter be deemed to be submitted
60 to this article.
61 (3) This article shall also apply to any association of owners subject to a recorded
62 declaration of covenants upon property, which covenants are administered by an owners'
63 association in which membership is mandatory for all owners of lots in the development
64 subject to such declaration, where 80 percent of the association votes to approve the
65 submission of such association to this article and records an instrument certifying such
66 vote. Such instrument shall give notice that the recordation of the instrument subjects the
