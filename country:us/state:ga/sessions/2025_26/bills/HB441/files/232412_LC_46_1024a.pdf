17 (2) Article I, Section I, Paragraph II of the Georgia Constitution provides, "Protection to
18 person and property is the paramount duty of government and shall be impartial and
19 complete. No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.";
20 (3) The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States requires that "[n]o
21 state...shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws";
22 (4) To fulfill such right to life and equal protection requirements, the lives of unborn
23 persons in this state should be protected with the same criminal and civil laws protecting
24 the lives of born persons by removing provisions that enable the commission of willful
25 prenatal homicide and assault; and
26 (5) Current provisions could be interpreted to allow a person to pressure a pregnant mother
27 to abort her child, and such provisions should be removed.
28 SECTION 2.
29 Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to crimes and offenses, is
30 amended by revising Code Section 16-3-26, relating to coercion, as follows:
31 "16-3-26.
32 A person is not guilty of a crime, except murder, if the act upon which the supposed
33 criminal liability is based is performed under such coercion that the person reasonably
34 believes that performing the act is the only way to prevent his imminent death or great
35 bodily injury.
36 (a) A person is not guilty of a crime if the act upon which the supposed criminal liability
37 is based is performed under such coercion that the person reasonably believes that the
38 performance of the act is the only way to prevent his or her imminent death or great bodily
39 injury.
40 (b) The defense of coercion provided by subsection (a) of this Code section shall not apply
41 to a charge of murder unless the victim is an unborn child and the defendant is the child's
42 mother."

55 when resulting from:
