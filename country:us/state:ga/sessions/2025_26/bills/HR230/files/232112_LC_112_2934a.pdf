5 professionals around the world who are dedicated to advancing patient care and digestive
6 health through education and advocacy and promoting excellence in gastrointestinal
7 endoscopy; and
8 WHEREAS, the number of uninsured or underinsured patients in the United States who have
9 a positive (abnormal) CRC screening test result who get a timely follow-up colonoscopy is
10 just 50 to 70 percent; and
11 WHEREAS, the low follow-up colonoscopy rate can be attributed to a diverse and complex

14 WHEREAS, CRC is now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50 and the second
15 leading cause of cancer death in women under 50 in the United States; and
16 WHEREAS, CRC has a 90 percent survival rate when detected early enough; and
17 WHEREAS, ASGE recommends that people who have not had colorectal cancer or polyps
18 or who do not have any high-risk factors for CRC should begin getting screened for CRC at
19 the age of 45; and
20 WHEREAS, ASGE is working with Community Health Care Systems, Inc., which is a
21 federally qualified health center that cares for patients in middle Georgia, on a project that
22 is designed to increase the follow-up colonoscopy rate for uninsured and underinsured people
23 who have a positive or abnormal stool-based CRC screening test; and
24 WHEREAS, Community Health Care Systems is identifying and assisting hundreds of
25 uninsured and underinsured patients to get screened for CRC using a stool-based DNA test
26 and to get a follow-up colonoscopy if it's necessary at no cost to the patients; and
27 WHEREAS, ASGE and Community Health Care Systems will support these patients with

34 WHEREAS, gastroenterologists perform colonoscopies to prevent or detect CRC by
35 removing colon polyps; and
36 WHEREAS, a follow-up colonoscopy is required after a positive non-colonoscopic screening
37 test result to derive the benefits of screening; and
38 WHEREAS, there are several other recommended options for CRC screening; and
39 WHEREAS, offering patients screening options can help increase patient adherence to
40 screening.
41 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
42 the members of this body recognize March 2025 as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month and
43 encourage eligible citizens to consult their health care providers and begin regular
44 screenings.
45 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that ASGE's project has the potential to lead to the
46 development of a public policy model and a toolkit that can be used to increase the follow-up
47 colonoscopy rate for underserved people across the United States and has the potential to
48 save countless lives.
49 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
50 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
51 public and the press.
