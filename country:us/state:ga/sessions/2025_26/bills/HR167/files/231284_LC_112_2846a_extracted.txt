House Resolution 167
of the 175th, and Dempsey of the 13th
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing February 6, 2025, as Alzheimer's Awareness Day in Georgia; and for other
2 purposes.
3 WHEREAS, Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60
4 to 80 percent of dementia cases; and
5 WHEREAS, Alzheimer's disease is not a normal part of aging; it is a progressive brain
6 disease that gets worse over time and is the seventh leading cause of death in Georgia; and
7 WHEREAS, because Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by memory loss, changes in
8 personality and behavior, and a tendency to wander, individuals with this disease are at an
9 increased risk for accidental injury, getting lost, and being abused, neglected, and exploited;
10 and
11 WHEREAS, more than 188,000 Georgians over age 65 are living with Alzheimer's disease,
12 and an estimated 374,000 family caregivers provide approximately 755 million hours of
13 unpaid care valued at more than $11 billion; and

25 LC 112 2846
14 WHEREAS, caregiving for individuals with Alzheimer's disease often takes an enormous
15 toll on family members; caregivers themselves often suffer more stress, depression, and
16 health problems than caregivers of people with other illnesses; and
17 WHEREAS, an increasing number of individuals are developing younger-onset Alzheimer's
18 disease, a form of the disease that occurs prior to age 65 and can be particularly difficult on
19 family dynamics and economics due to its early occurrence; and
20 WHEREAS, there is an economic impact of Alzheimer's disease upon the business, medical,
21 and caregiver communities of Georgia; and
22 WHEREAS, it is abundantly fitting and proper that the State of Georgia and the Georgia
23 Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association commit a day to increasing awareness of Alzheimer's
24 disease and other dementias to address the needs of this growing segment of Georgia's
25 population.
26 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
27 the members of this body recognize February 6, 2025, as Alzheimer's Awareness Day in
28 Georgia.
29 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
30 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
31 public and the press.
