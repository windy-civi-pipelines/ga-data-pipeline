188 members of the arbitration panel shall receive the same per diem, expenses, and allowances
189 for their service on the panel as authorized by law for members of the General Assembly
190 plus $100.00 in total for all days of service for serving on an arbitration panel.
191 (e) If the panel so agrees, any one or more additional annexation disputes which may arise
192 between the parties prior to the panel's initial meeting may be consolidated for the purpose
193 of judicial economy if there are similar issues of location or similar objections raised to

182 county with a caption describing the name of the current owner of the property, recording
183 reference of the current owner's acquisition deed and a general description of the property,
184 and plainly showing the expiration date of any restrictions or conditions.
185 (c) The arbitration panel shall be dissolved on the tenth day after it renders its findings and
186 recommendations but may be reconvened as provided in Code Section 36-36-116.
187 (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Code Section 45-7-21, the
188 members of the arbitration panel shall receive the same per diem, expenses, and allowances
189 for their service on the panel as authorized by law for members of the General Assembly

192 between the parties prior to the panel's initial meeting may be consolidated for the purpose
193 of judicial economy if there are similar issues of location or similar objections raised to
