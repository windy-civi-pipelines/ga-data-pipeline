162 property, which may include, but not be limited to, adopted planning documents and
163 capital or infrastructure plans.
164 (4) The cost of the arbitration shall be equally divided between the city and the county;

169 or owners whose property is at issue shall be borne by the county and the city in the same

181 reference of the current owner's acquisition deed and a general description of the property,
182 and plainly showing the expiration date of any restrictions or conditions.
183 (c) The arbitration panel shall be dissolved on the tenth day after it renders its findings and
184 recommendations but may be reconvened as provided in Code Section 36-36-116.
185 (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Code Section 45-7-21, the
186 members of the arbitration panel shall receive the same per diem, expenses, and allowances
187 for their service on the panel as authorized by law for members of the General Assembly
188 plus $100.00 in total for all days of service for serving on an arbitration panel.
189 (e) If the panel so agrees, any one or more additional annexation disputes which may arise
190 between the parties prior to the panel's initial meeting may be consolidated for the purpose
191 of judicial economy if there are similar issues of location or similar objections raised to
192 such other annexations or the property to be annexed in such other annexations is

156 areas of the county which have a similar impact on infrastructure as complained of by
157 the county in its objection; and
158 (G) Whether the infrastructure or capital outlay project which is claimed adversely
159 impacted by the county in its objection was funded by a county-wide tax.

161 land use plan and the pattern of existing land uses and zonings in the area of the subject
162 property, which may include, but not be limited to, adopted planning documents and
163 capital or infrastructure plans.
164 (4) The cost of the arbitration shall be equally divided between the city and the county;

167 position.
168 (5) The reasonable costs of participation in the arbitration process of the property owner
169 or owners whose property is at issue shall be borne by the county and the city in the same
170 proportion as costs are apportioned under paragraph (4) of this subsection.

175 maintain a data base and record of arbitration panel results and at least annually publish
176 a report on such decisions and make such report freely available on the department's
177 website.

179 findings and recommendations of the panel shall be recorded in the deed records of the
180 county with a caption describing the name of the current owner of the property, recording
181 reference of the current owner's acquisition deed and a general description of the property,
182 and plainly showing the expiration date of any restrictions or conditions.
183 (c) The arbitration panel shall be dissolved on the tenth day after it renders its findings and
184 recommendations but may be reconvened as provided in Code Section 36-36-116.
185 (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Code Section 45-7-21, the
186 members of the arbitration panel shall receive the same per diem, expenses, and allowances
187 for their service on the panel as authorized by law for members of the General Assembly
188 plus $100.00 in total for all days of service for serving on an arbitration panel.
189 (e) If the panel so agrees, any one or more additional annexation disputes which may arise
190 between the parties prior to the panel's initial meeting may be consolidated for the purpose
191 of judicial economy if there are similar issues of location or similar objections raised to
192 such other annexations or the property to be annexed in such other annexations is
