177 (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Code Section 45-7-21, the
178 members of the arbitration panel shall receive the same per diem, expenses, and allowances
179 for their service on the panel as authorized by law for members of the General Assembly

181 (e) If the panel so agrees, any one or more additional annexation disputes which may arise
182 between the parties prior to the panel's initial meeting may be consolidated for the purpose
183 of judicial economy if there are similar issues of location or similar objections raised to
184 such other annexations or the property to be annexed in such other annexations is
185 within 2,500 feet of the subject property."
