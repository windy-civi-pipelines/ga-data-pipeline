Senate Resolution 251

28th, Jackson of the 41st and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing May 2025 as Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month; and for other
2 purposes.
3 WHEREAS, an estimated 54 million Americans have osteoporosis or low bone mass, and
4 studies suggest that approximately 1 in 2 women and up to 1 in 4 men age 50 and older will
5 break a bone due to osteoporosis; and
6 WHEREAS, around 1.8 million Medicare beneficiaries suffer approximately 2.1 million
7 osteoporosis-related fractures annually, and osteoporosis-related bone fractures are
8 responsible for more hospitalizations than heart attacks, strokes, or breast cancer; and
9 WHEREAS, the total annual cost for osteoporosis-related fractures among Medicare
10 beneficiaries was $57 billion in 2018, and that number is expected to grow to over $95
11 billion in 2040 without reforms as the population ages; and
12 WHEREAS, in Georgia, over 48,000 Medicare beneficiaries suffered more than 56,400
13 osteoporosis-related fractures in 2016; and

14 WHEREAS, an estimated 7,000 Georgians on Medicare suffered not only an initial fracture
15 but also a subsequent fracture, resulting in estimated costs of over $131 million; and
16 WHEREAS, osteoporosis and the broken bones it can cause are not part of normal aging.
17 Building strong bones begins in childhood and is essential to the prevention of osteoporosis;
18 care for our bones is important throughout our lives, but we reach our peak bone mass by
19 early adulthood; and
20 WHEREAS, optimum bone health and prevention of osteoporosis can be maximized by a
21 balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening
22 exercise, and a healthy lifestyle with no smoking or excessive alcohol intake; and
23 WHEREAS, osteoporosis is often called a silent disease because one cannot feel bones
24 weakening. Breaking a bone is often the first sign of osteoporosis. Timely bone health
25 screening, diagnosis, and treatment can help prevent fractures leading to hospitalization and
26 nursing home stays; and
27 WHEREAS, cost effective post-fracture care that improves care coordination has been
28 demonstrated to reduce the number of subsequent or repeat fractures yet is not widely
29 available or properly incentivized by Medicare; and
30 WHEREAS, it is crucial that we raise awareness about bone health and osteoporosis among
31 the public, health professionals, and policy makers.
32 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
33 recognize May 2025 as Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month.
