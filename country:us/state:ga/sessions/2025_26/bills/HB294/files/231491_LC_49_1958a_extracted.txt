23 demonstration of subject area competency, instead of or in combination with completion
24 of courses of classroom instruction. Such policies and guidelines shall clearly delineate the
25 manner in which students can earn credit, how mastery of standards will be assessed, how
26 locally developed assessments will be reviewed and approved, how such credit will be
27 recorded on high school transcripts, and when outcomes as a result of these policies and
28 guidelines will be reviewed. The state board shall adopt such policies and establish
29 guidelines, and such policies and guidelines shall be applicable beginning with the
30 2013-2014 2025-2026 school year.
31 (b) Students may earn credits through:
32 (1) The completion of courses; or
33 (2) The testing out or otherwise demonstrating mastery of the course content.
34 (c) The state board shall identify assessments, including various commercial assessments,
35 for immediate use for students to demonstrate subject area competency, which may
36 include, but not be limited to:
37 (1) Advanced placement exams;
38 (2) ACT course assessment;

48 options to three credits per student until the practice is proven to yield student outcomes
49 at least equivalent to those found in standard seat-time courses. The policy shall ensure
50 that credit for demonstrated proficiency is reported on student transcripts in the same way
51 that seat-time credit is recorded. The state board shall review such policy after three years
52 to determine if student outcomes from these educational options are equivalent to, if not
53 better than, student outcomes in traditional courses.
54 (e) No policy, guideline, and process established by the state board pursuant to this Code
55 section shall authorize the State School Superintendent to deny, delay, or otherwise
56 interfere with the approval of any performance based assessment identified and approved
57 by the state board pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) of this Code section.
58 (d)(f) Each local school system shall comply with the state board's plan policies,
59 guidelines, and processes adopted pursuant to this Code section and shall award units of
60 high school credit in accordance with such plan policies, guidelines, and processes. Local
61 boards of education and charter schools other public school governing bodies shall
62 establish implementation policies and shall be prohibited from setting policies that negate
63 or otherwise prohibit access to such plan impede compliance with such policies, guidelines,
64 and processes.
65 (g) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require any local school system or
66 public school to include any advanced placement or international baccalaureate course
67 among the courses that are available to students enrolled in such local school system or
68 public school."
