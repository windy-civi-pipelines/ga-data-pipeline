154 voted in such primary or election or shall be unable to determine within three days
155 following such primary or election whether such person timely registered to vote and was

165 registrars shall process the official voter registration application form completed by such
166 persons pursuant to Code Section 21-2-224.1 or 21-2-418 and shall add such persons to
