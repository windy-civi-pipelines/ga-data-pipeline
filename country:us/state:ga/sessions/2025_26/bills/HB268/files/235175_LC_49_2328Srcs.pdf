1538 school shall verify that any intervention services provided to the student at the previous
1539 school remain in place until the threat management team of the receiving school
1540 independently determines the need for intervention services. Upon the student's transfer

1577 local school systems and schools. The office shall conduct unannounced inspections of all
1578 public schools while school is in session, triennially, and investigate reports of
1579 noncompliance with school safety requirements. Within three school days after the
1580 unannounced inspection, the office shall provide a copy of the completed school safety
1581 compliance inspection report, including any photographs or other evidence of
1582 noncompliance, to the school safety director; the school principal, as appropriate, and the
