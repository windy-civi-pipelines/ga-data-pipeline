1472 (2) A threat management team shall be formed at the discretion of the local school
1473 superintendent and local sheriff's office, and shall include persons with expertise in
1474 counseling, mental health instruction, school administration, and law enforcement. All
1475 members of the threat management team shall be involved in the threat assessment and
1476 threat management process and final decision making. At least one member of the threat
1477 management team shall have personal familiarity with the individual who is the subject
1478 of the threat assessment, and if such individual has an Individualized Education Program
1479 (IEP) plan or a Section 504 plan, at least one member of the threat management team
1480 shall have personal familiarity with such plan. If no member of the threat management
1481 team has such familiarity, an educator, as defined in Code Section 20-2-982.1, who is
1482 personally familiar with the individual who is the subject of the threat assessment shall
1483 consult with the threat management team for the purpose of assessing the threat. The
1484 educator who provides such consultation shall not participate in the decision-making
1485 process;
1486 (3) The threat management team shall identify members of the school community to
1487 whom threatening behavior should be reported and provide guidance to students, faculty,
1488 and staff regarding recognition of threatening or aberrant behavior that may represent a
1489 threat to the community, school, or self;
1490 (4) Upon the availability of the state-wide behavioral threat assessment indicator, all
1491 threat management teams shall use that indicator when evaluating the behavior of
1492 students who may pose a threat to the school, school staff, or students and to coordinate
1493 intervention and services for such students;
1494 (5) Upon a preliminary determination that a student poses a threat of violence or physical
1495 harm to himself or herself or others, a threat management team shall immediately report
1496 its determination to the local school superintendent or his or her designee, local law
H. B. 268 (SUB)

25 LC 49 2326S
1497 enforcement, and the office. The local school superintendent or his or her designee shall
1498 immediately attempt to notify the student's parent or legal guardian and will determine
1499 who within the threat management team is the most appropriate to handle the situation.
1500 Nothing in this subsection precludes the local school system from acting immediately to
1501 address an imminent threat;
1502 (6) Upon a preliminary determination by the threat management team that a student
1503 poses a threat of violence to himself or herself or others or exhibits significantly
1504 disruptive behavior or need for assistance, authorized members of the threat management
1505 team shall submit a report to the office, who will use the S3 Database to complete its own
1506 report based on all available state resources on the individual of concern. A member of
1507 a threat management team may not disclose any information gathered during the creation
1508 of the report, gathered on the individual of concern from the office, or otherwise use any
1509 record of an individual beyond the purpose for which such disclosure was made to the
1510 threat management team;
1511 (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all state and local agencies and programs
1512 that provide services to students experiencing or at risk of demonstrating behavior which
1513 indicates they may harm themselves or others, including, but not limited to, local school
1514 systems, school personnel, state and local law enforcement agencies, the Department of
1515 Juvenile Justice, the Department of Human Services, the Division of Family and Children
1516 Services, the Department of Education, the Office of the Child Advocate for the
1517 Protection of Children, and any service or support provider contracting with such
1518 agencies, should submit concerns to the office using the S3 Database to ensure the safety
1519 of the student or others;
1520 (8) If an immediate mental health or substance abuse crisis is suspected, school
1521 personnel shall follow steps established by the threat management team to engage
1522 behavioral health crisis resources. Behavioral health crisis resources, including, but not
1523 limited to, mobile crisis teams and school resource officers trained in crisis intervention,
H. B. 268 (SUB)
- 59 -

25 LC 49 2326S
1524 shall provide emergency intervention and assessment, make recommendations, and refer
1525 the student for appropriate services. Onsite school personnel shall report all such
1526 situations and actions taken to the threat management team, which shall contact the other
1527 agencies involved with the student and any known service providers to share information
1528 and coordinate any necessary follow-up actions. Upon the student's transfer to a different
1529 school within the same local school system, the threat management team of the receiving
1530 school shall verify that any intervention services provided to the student at the previous
1531 school remain in place until the threat management team of the receiving school
1532 independently determines the need for intervention services. Upon the student's transfer
1533 to a school outside of such local school system, the threat management team at the
1534 receiving school shall be provided access to the student's critical records as needed to
1535 determine the need for intervention services;
1536 (9) If human trafficking or gang affiliation is suspected, school personnel shall follow
1537 steps established by the threat management team to seek law enforcement assistance and
1538 to identify appropriate interventions for the safety of the student from outside criminal
1539 syndicates;
1540 (10) The threat management team shall prepare a threat assessment report required by
1541 the state-wide behavioral threat assessment indicator. A threat assessment report, all
1542 corresponding documentation, and any other information required by the state-wide
1543 behavioral threat assessment indicator shall be submitted to the office through the S3
1544 Database. Reports, tips, and information submitted into the S3 Database shall become
1545 an S3 record; and
1546 (11) Each local board of education shall establish a threat management coordinator to
1547 serve as the primary point of contact regarding the local school system's coordination,
1548 communication, and implementation of the threat management program and to report
1549 quantitative data to the office.

1551 By August 1 of each year, the office shall:
1552 (1) Evaluate each local school system's use of the state-wide behavioral threat
1553 management operational process, the state-wide behavioral threat assessment indicator,
1554 and the S3 Database for compliance with this part;
1555 (2) Notify the local school superintendent, as applicable, if the use of the state-wide
1556 behavioral threat management operational process, the state-wide behavioral threat
1557 assessment indicator, or the S3 Database is not in compliance with this part; and
1558 (3) Report any issues of ongoing noncompliance with this part to the commissioner of
1559 Juvenile Justice and the local school superintendent, as applicable.
1560 20-2-1186.9.
1561 (a)(1) By August 1, 2025, the office shall develop and adopt a school safety compliance
1562 inspection report to document compliance or noncompliance with school safety
1563 requirements mandated by law, rule, or regulation and adherence to established school
1564 safety best practices to evaluate the safety, security, and emergency response of the
1565 school.
1566 (2) Upon the adoption of the report and upon any revisions to the report, the office shall
1567 provide a blank copy of such report to each local school superintendent.
1568 (b) The office shall monitor compliance with requirements relating to school safety by
1569 local school systems and schools. The office shall conduct unannounced inspections of all
1570 public schools while school is in session, triennially, and investigate reports of
1571 noncompliance with school safety requirements. Within three school days after the
1572 unannounced inspection, the office shall provide a copy of the completed school safety
1573 compliance inspection report, including any photographs or other evidence of
1574 noncompliance, to the school safety director; the school principal, as appropriate, and the
1575 local school superintendent. The school safety director shall acknowledge, in writing,

25 LC 49 2326S
1576 receipt of the report within one school day after receipt. The office shall reinspect any
1577 school with documented deficiencies within six months. The school safety director, or his
1578 or her designee, shall provide the office with written notice of how the noncompliance has
1579 been remediated within three school days after receipt of the report.
1580 (c) The office shall provide quarterly reports to each local school superintendent and school
1581 safety director identifying the number and percentage of schools inspected or reinspected
1582 during that quarter and the number and percentage of inspected schools that had no school
1583 safety requirement deficiencies. Annually, during the first quarter of every school year, the
1584 school safety director shall report to the local board of education in a public meeting the
1585 number of schools inspected during the preceding calendar year and the number and
1586 percentage of schools in compliance during the initial inspection and reinspection."
1587 SECTION 23.
1588 Code Section 16-11-37 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to terroristic
1589 threats and acts and penalties, is amended by revising paragraph (1) of subsection (d) and by
1590 adding new subsections to read as follows:
1591 "(d)(1) A person convicted of the offense of a terroristic threat shall be punished as for
1592 a misdemeanor; provided, however, that, if the threat suggested the death of the
1593 threatened individual or threatened the death of, or serious injury to, a group of
1594 individuals who are or will likely be at or within a school, the person convicted shall be
1595 guilty of a felony and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00,
1596 imprisonment for not less than one nor more than five years, or both."
1597 "(f) Any parent or legal guardian who intentionally advises, counsels, encourages, aids, or
1598 abets his or her minor child in the commission of an offense prohibited by paragraph (1)
1599 of subsection (d) of this Code section, relating to threatening the death of, or serious injury
1600 to, a group of individuals who are or will likely be at or within a school, shall be deemed

H. B. 268 (SUB)
- 62 -

25 LC 49 2326S
1602 16-2-20, and may be charged with and convicted of the commission of such offense as a
1603 party thereto.
1604 (g) Whenever there is a credible accusation that a person threatened, whether verbally, in
1605 writing, or otherwise, the death of, or serious injury to, a group of individuals, pursuant to
1606 paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of this Code section, who are or will likely be at or within
1607 a school and that the person who made the threat is enrolled in the school, such school shall
1608 immediately reassign such person to remote learning and provide him or her with
1609 counseling while the school and other parties investigate the allegation or information
1610 related to the threat. Once the school has made a substantive finding related to the threat,
1611 it may discontinue the remote learning assignment and impose relevant discipline, as
1612 appropriate."
1613 SECTION 24.
1614 Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to
1615 inspection of public records, is amended in Code Section 50-18-72, relating to when public
