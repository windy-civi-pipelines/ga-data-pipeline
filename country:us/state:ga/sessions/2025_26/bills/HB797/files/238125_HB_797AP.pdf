12 SECTION 2.
13 Findings.
14 It is found and determined that:
15 (1) Public and private agencies are less effective in responding to people experiencing
16 homelessness when programs are not coordinated and administered in a systematic
17 manner under a comprehensive plan;
18 (2) A continuum of care is a year-round planning body of representative stakeholders in
19 a community's work toward ending homelessness that coordinates the community's
20 policies, strategies, and activities toward ending homelessness. Continuums of care
21 gather and analyze information to determine the local needs of people experiencing
22 homelessness, implement strategic responses, and measure results. Continuums of care
23 set the local processes for applying, reviewing, and prioritizing project applications for
24 funding each year in the continuum of care program completion;
25 (3) The Chatham-Savannah Authority for the Homeless was created by the General
26 Assembly prior to the requirement under federal law that a continuum of care be
27 established for Chatham County;
28 (4) The stakeholders of Chatham County and the City of Savannah have created a
29 continuum of care and named that organization the Interagency Council on Homelessness
30 for Chatham-Savannah;
31 (5) There are four major functions of the Interagency Council on Homelessness for
32 Chatham-Savannah:
33 (A) Supporting the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development
34 required operations of the continuum of care;
35 (B) Designing and supporting, or contracting for, the operations of a homeless
36 management information system for the continuum of care;
37 (C) Continuum of care planning; and

25 LC 62 0142/AP
38 (D) Supporting collaborative applicants in preparing and submitting applications for
39 funds in accordance with 24 C.F.R. Sections 578.7 and 578.9;
40 (6) The Interagency Council on Homelessness for Chatham-Savannah is established to
41 serve as the continuum of care board of directors for the purpose of facilitating
42 interagency and cross-sector coordination in planning, policymaking, program
43 development, system performance monitoring, budget planning, and coordination of
44 federal homeless assistance resources on behalf of the continuum of care;
45 (7) The Interagency Council on Homelessness for Chatham-Savannah has the
46 responsibility to comply with Housing and Urban Development requirements under 24
47 C.F.R. Part 578 in all matters, including guiding principles of membership and
48 participation;
49 (8) The Interagency Council on Homelessness for Chatham-Savannah must have a
50 collaborative applicant who manages and administers a homeless management
51 information system and administers a coordinated entry system, leads an annual point in
52 time count, and assists with the notice of funding opportunity process, including the
53 preparation and final submission of the community collaborative application. The
54 Chatham-Savannah Authority for the Homeless is the collaborative applicant; and
55 (9) The City of Savannah created an Interagency Council on Homelessness in 2023 that
56 presently has a board composed of ten governmental seats, three officers, and others.
