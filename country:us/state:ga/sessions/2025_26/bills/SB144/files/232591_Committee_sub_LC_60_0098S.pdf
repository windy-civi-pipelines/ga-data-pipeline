25 LC 60 0098S
The Senate Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs offered the following
substitute to SB 144:
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Article 6 of Chapter 7 of Title 2 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated,
2 relating to liability for use of fertilizers, plant growth regulators, or pesticides, so as to clarify
3 that a manufacturer cannot be held liable for failing to warn consumers of health risks above
4 those required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with respect to
5 pesticides; to provide for legislative findings; to provide for related matters; to provide for
6 applicability; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.
7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
8 SECTION 1.
9 The General Assembly finds that:
10 (1) Agriculture and its related industries contribute over $91 billion to Georgia's economy,
11 and Georgia farmers are the backbone of that activity;
12 (2) As the nation's largest producer of peanuts and the second largest producer of cotton,
13 Georgia farmers rely on inputs to grow their crops and keep yields high;
14 (3) Without reliable access to the most widely used crop protection products, costs to
15 farmers could more than double;

25 LC 60 0098S
16 (4) A domestic supply chain for crop protection products is critical to ensuring farmers
17 have access to all the tools they need to grow food and fiber;
18 (5) Dependence on Chinese imports for critical ingredients in crop protection products
19 creates supply chain vulnerabilities for the United States and opportunities for foreign
20 adversaries to restrict access to crop protection products for American farmers; and
21 (6) Every effort must be made to strengthen the United States domestic production of
22 pesticides, including clarifying regulatory authority of pesticide labeling.
23 SECTION 2.
24 Article 6 of Chapter 7 of Title 2 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to
25 liability for use of fertilizers, plant growth regulators, or pesticides, is amended by adding
26 a new Code section to read as follows:
27 "2-7-171.
28 (a) As used in this Code section, the term:
29 (1) 'Environmental Protection Agency' means the United States Environmental
30 Protection Agency.
31 (2) 'FIFRA' means the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C.
32 Section 136, et seq., and the amendments thereto.
33 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, beginning on January 1, 2026,
34 any pesticide registered with the Commissioner, pursuant to Code Section 2-7-55, or the
35 Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to FIFRA, which displays a label that has been
36 approved by the Environmental Protection Agency in registering the pesticide or is
37 consistent with the most recent human health risk assessment performed under FIFRA shall
38 be deemed a sufficient warning label for the purposes of an action commenced under any
39 provision of state law concerning the duty to warn or label, or any other common law duty
40 to warn."
