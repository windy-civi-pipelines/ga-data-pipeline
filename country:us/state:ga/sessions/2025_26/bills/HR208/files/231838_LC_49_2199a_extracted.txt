4 WHEREAS, more than 1.7 million children are enrolled in Georgia's public schools; and

6 schools are uniquely discriminatory in singling out the Native American community for
7 derision and cultural appropriation; and
8 WHEREAS, although the inappropriate use of Native American names, symbols, or images

12 WHEREAS, numerous individuals and organizations, including the United States
13 Commission on Civil Rights, have concluded that the use of Native American names,
