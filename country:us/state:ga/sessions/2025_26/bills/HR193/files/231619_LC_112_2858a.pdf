A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing and commending Haven House; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, the Flint Circuit Council on Family Violence Inc. was organized as a 501(c)(3)

4 system at a time when domestic violence was only beginning to be recognized as a societal
5 issue; and
6 WHEREAS, in 1999, the agency secured a house formerly known as the Hampton Boys
7 Home, and following renovations, Haven House was opened later that year as a shelter for
8 survivors and their children to stay after leaving a violent situation; and
9 WHEREAS, as the organization expanded its mission, Haven House began offering
10 additional services to survivors, including financial assistance, support groups,
11 transportation, and a food pantry, alongside its core legal advocacy and case management
12 programs; and
13 WHEREAS, due to the increasing need for shelter and support services, Haven House, with
14 the support of the Henry County Commissioners and dedicated board members, opened a
15 new facility in June 2011 capable of housing 48 adults and children; and
