17 case the remaining members of the board of education shall, by majority vote, select a
18 qualified person to fill the vacancy until the person elected at such special election takes
19 office; and
20 (B) If the vacancy occurs 90 days or fewer before the date of a general election
21 preceding the general election at which a successor will be elected to a new full term
22 of office, then the remaining members of the local board of education shall, by majority
23 vote, select a qualified person to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term.
24 (2) Any person elected or appointed to fill a vacancy pursuant to this subsection shall
25 possess the same qualifications required for election to a full term of office as provided
26 by law applicable to the office wherein the vacancy occurred. As applied to special
27 elections, if the office wherein the vacancy occurred is filled by election of voters within
28 a portion of the local school district, then the special election shall be held within that
29 portion of the local school district; provided, however, that, if the office wherein the
30 vacancy occurred is filled by the voters within the entire school district, then the special
31 election shall be held within the entire school district.
32 (3) The election superintendent of Muscogee County shall issue the call for a special
33 election to fill a vacancy as required by this subsection. The call for a special election
34 shall be issued within 30 days after the existence of a vacancy has been established. A
35 special election to fill vacancies shall be held and conducted in accordance with the
36 applicable provisions of Chapter 2 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., known as the 'Georgia
37 Election Code.'"
38 SECTION 2.
39 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
