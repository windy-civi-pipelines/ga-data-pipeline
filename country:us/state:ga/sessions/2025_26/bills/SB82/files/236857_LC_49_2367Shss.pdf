44 provided, however, that a denial of a petition by a local board shall not preclude the
45 submission to the local board of a revised petition that addresses deficiencies cited in the

47 conversion charter school, including, but not limited to, a conversion charter for a high

50 instructional staff members of the petitioning local school at a public meeting called
51 with two weeks' advance notice for the purpose of deciding whether to submit the
52 petition to the local board for its approval; and
53 (B) Has been freely agreed to, by secret ballot, by a majority of the parents or
54 guardians of students enrolled in the petitioning local school present at a public meeting
