79 use of such system in the state; provided, however, that any prior approved system shall
80 continue to be approved for installation in every county of the state pursuant to the
81 manufacturer's recommendations, including sizing of no less than 50 percent of trench
82 length of a conventional system designed for equal flows in similar soil conditions. Upon

103 bond shall be a cash bond of $10,000.00 or executed by a surety authorized and qualified
104 to write surety bonds in the State of Georgia and shall be approved by the local county
105 or municipal health department. Such bond shall be conditioned upon all work done or
106 supervised by such certificate holder complying with the provisions of any state
107 construction codes or any ordinances or building and construction codes of any county

113 shall in no event exceed the sum of such bond.
114 (3) In any case where a bond is required under this subsection, the certified septic tank
115 installer or certified septic tank pumper shall file a copy of the bond with the county or

80 continue to be approved for installation in every county of the state pursuant to the
81 manufacturer's recommendations, including sizing of no less than 50 percent of trench
82 length of a conventional system designed for equal flows in similar soil conditions. Upon

101 septic tank pumper may execute and deposit with the judge of the probate court in the
102 county of his or her principal place of business a bond in the sum of $10,000.00. Such
103 bond shall be a cash bond of $10,000.00 or executed by a surety authorized and qualified
104 to write surety bonds in the State of Georgia and shall be approved by the local county
105 or municipal health department. Such bond shall be conditioned upon all work done or
106 supervised by such certificate holder complying with the provisions of any state
107 construction codes or any ordinances or building and construction codes of any county
108 or municipal corporation wherein the work is performed. Action on such bond may be
109 brought against the principal and surety thereon in the name of and for the benefit of any
110 person who suffers damages as a consequence of said certificate holder's work not
111 conforming to the requirements of any ordinances or building and construction codes;
112 provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the surety to all persons so damaged
113 shall in no event exceed the sum of such bond.
114 (3) In any case where a bond is required under this subsection, the certified septic tank
115 installer or certified septic tank pumper shall file a copy of the bond with the county or
116 municipal health department in the political subdivision wherein the work is being
117 performed.
