9 symptoms: tics or other abnormal movements, severe separation anxiety, generalized anxiety,
10 irritability, aggression, personality changes, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, marked
11 deterioration in learning and school performance, and developmental regression, including

16 WHEREAS, researchers at leading academic institutions are engaged in extensive research
17 on the disease mechanism of and effective treatments for these disorders; and
18 WHEREAS, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) is developing a pilot clinic to treat
19 children with PANS and PANDAS; and
20 WHEREAS, the 2019 PANS Study Committee Report of the House of Representatives
21 identified specific policy goals for Georgia regarding insurance coverage for diagnosis and
22 treatment; pediatric provider training in medical, educational, and behavioral health settings;
23 and increased public health surveillance of these disorders; and
24 WHEREAS, the deep medical and bioscience resources in Georgia make our state well
25 situated to meaningfully contribute to best medical practices, research, and medical
26 technology to advance the early diagnosis and treatment of children with PANS and
27 PANDAS; and
28 WHEREAS, expert providers in the PANS consortium estimate that one in 200 children have
29 PANS or PANDAS, meaning these diseases affect roughly 15,000 children in Georgia; and
30 WHEREAS, many general pediatricians, nurse practitioners, and pediatric subspecialists are
31 not familiar with the most current diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines for these
32 disorders; and
33 WHEREAS, in addition to lack of access to treating providers, many insurers do not cover
34 treatment for PANS and PANDAS, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, placing the
35 treatment out of reach for most families; and
