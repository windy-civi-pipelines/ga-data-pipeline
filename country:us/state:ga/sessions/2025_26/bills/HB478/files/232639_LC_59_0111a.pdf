17 planning, predicting, acting, or communicating; provided, however, that artificial
18 intelligence systems may vary in the forms of information they can receive and in the
19 human cognitive processes they can emulate."
20 SECTION 2.
21 Said part is further amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
22 "10-1-393.20.
23 (a) On or after July 1, 2025, any individual engaged in the dissemination of AI generated
24 content to facilitate commerce or trade shall ensure such content includes a disclosure that
25 artificial intelligence was used to make all or part of such content.
26 (b) Disclosures required under subsection (a) of this Code section for AI generated content
27 that involves the use, in whole or in part, of visual media shall be:
28 (1) In writing and completed in each written language used in such content; and
29 (2) Clearly readable, which shall mean that the text of the disclosure shall:
30 (A) Appear in letters equal to or greater than 30 percent of the vertical picture height;
31 (B) Be visible for a period of at least 30 percent of the media's length, in the case of
32 moving images and video; and
33 (C) Appear with a reasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the
34 text of the statement. A statement satisfies the color contrast requirement of this
35 subparagraph if it is printed in black text on a white background or if the degree of
36 color contrast between the background and the text of the statement is no less than the
37 color contrast between the background and the largest type size used in the content.
38 (c) Disclosures required under subsection (a) of this Code section for AI generated content
39 that involves the use, in whole or in part, of audible media shall be announced, articulated,
40 spoken, or otherwise rendered completely using the same audible volume, the same rate
41 of speaking as measured in words per minute, and each spoken language as used in such
42 content.

46 file disseminated in facilitating commerce or trade that omits disclosures required under
47 subsection (a) of this Code section shall constitute a separate violation."
