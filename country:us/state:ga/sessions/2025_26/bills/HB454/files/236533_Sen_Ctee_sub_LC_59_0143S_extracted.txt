257 this state located on public property. Such registry shall contain, at a minimum, a
258 description of each monument, the location of such monument, and a statement as to
259 whether the monument itself is privately or publicly owned and the name of the owner.
260 Such registry shall include monuments that are in storage as well as monuments on public
261 display. No later than December 31, 2025, each agency shall send to the Department of
262 Community Affairs a comprehensive list of all monuments within the jurisdiction of such
263 agency containing the information set forth in this Code section. Thereafter, any time a
264 monument is relocated to a place that is different from the location on the monument
265 registry maintained by the Department of Community Affairs the agency within whose
266 jurisdiction such monument is located shall immediately notify the Department of
267 Community Affairs of the new location of the monument."

25 LC 59 0143S
221 (8) In all cases when there has been an alleged violation of this Code section, the
222 Attorney General or the district attorney of the county in which the monument was
223 located may represent the interests of the monument owner, the interests of others with
224 interest in the monument, and the interests of the state as parens patriae in all legal
225 matters pertaining to the enforcement of this Code section. The Attorney General or the

234 of the county in which such monument is located of such intent and, if the agency desires

236 party that would be interested in receiving such monument for public display. No action
237 with regard to removing or relocating such monument shall be taken by the agency until
238 the expiration of the 90 day period, provided that such period shall be tolled during the
239 pendency of any litigation requesting an injunction to prevent such agency from
240 removing such monument from public display or relocating such monument or requesting
241 other sanctions under this Code section until a decision on the merits of such litigation
242 is final. Except as may be otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, at the
243 conclusion of the 90 day period, the agency shall either safely store and maintain such
244 monument or, if a third party so requests, transfer the monument to such third party,
245 provided that such third party agrees to publicly display the monument at either a location
246 owned by such third party or a location owned by a public agency that such third party
247 has permission to use for such display. In the event that multiple third parties are
- 10 -

25 LC 59 0143S
248 interested in receiving such monument for public display, preference shall be given to the
249 third party that is willing to publicly display such monument in a location within the
250 jurisdiction where the monument is located. The agency shall be responsible for all costs
251 of moving and placing the monument in a new location."
252 "(d) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed so as to interfere with the rights of any
253 private monument owner. For the purposes of protection pursuant to this Code section, any
254 monument found to be privately owned shall be treated as publicly owned. No transfer of
255 title of such a monument is conveyed by this Code section.
256 (e) The Department of Community Affairs shall establish a registry of all monuments in
257 this state located on public property. Such registry shall contain, at a minimum, a
258 description of each monument, the location of such monument, and a statement as to
259 whether the monument itself is privately or publicly owned and the name of the owner.
260 Such registry shall include monuments that are in storage as well as monuments on public
261 display. No later than December 31, 2025, each agency shall send to the Department of
262 Community Affairs a comprehensive list of all monuments within the jurisdiction of such
263 agency containing the information set forth in this Code section. Thereafter, any time a
264 monument is relocated to a place that is different from the location on the monument
265 registry maintained by the Department of Community Affairs the agency within whose
266 jurisdiction such monument is located shall immediately notify the Department of
267 Community Affairs of the new location of the monument."
268 PART III
269 SECTION 3-1.
270 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
