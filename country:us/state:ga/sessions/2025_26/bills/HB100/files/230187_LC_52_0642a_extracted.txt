By: Representatives Douglas of the 78th, Hawkins of the 27th, Au of the 50th, Prince of the
132nd, Bennett of the 94th, and others
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Chapter 24 of Title 33 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to
2 insurance generally, so as to require all health insurers to pass along no less than 80 percent
3 of all prescription drug rebates to enrollees that such insurer receives from third parties with
4 regard to such enrollee's prescription drugs; to provide for definitions; to provide for related
5 matters; to provide for a short title; to provide for legislative findings; to provide for an
6 effective date and applicability; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.
7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
8 SECTION 1.
9 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Prescription Drug Consumer Financial
10 Protection Act."
11 SECTION 2.
12 The General Assembly finds:
13 (1) The citizens of this state frequently rely on state-regulated commercial insurers to
14 secure access to the prescription medicines needed to protect their health;
H. B. 100

25 LC 52 0642
15 (2) Commercial insurance plans increasingly require enrollees to bear significant
16 out-of-pocket costs for their prescription medicines;
17 (3) High out-of-pocket costs of prescription medicines impact the ability of enrollees to
18 start new and necessary medicines and to stay adherent to their prescriptions;
19 (4) High or unpredictable cost sharing requirements are a main driver of unaffordable
20 enrollee out-of-pocket costs;
21 (5) The burdens of high or unpredictable cost sharing requirements are borne
22 disproportionately by enrollees with chronic or debilitating conditions;
23 (6) Pharmaceutical manufacturers may offer sizeable rebates, discounts, and price
24 concessions in connection with the dispensing or administration of a therapy, but
25 enrollees do not necessarily financially benefit from these amounts at the point of sale,
26 and, instead, insurers or other intermediaries may retain the value of rebates, discounts,
27 and price concessions;
28 (7) Restrictions are needed on the ability of insurers and their intermediaries to retain
29 rebates, discounts, and price concessions that instead should be directly passed on to
30 enrollees as cost savings;
31 (8) Enrollees need equitable and accessible health coverage that does not impose unfair
32 cost sharing burdens upon them; and
33 (9) The legislature intends that enrollees receive the benefit of meaningful and durable
34 cost savings from rebates and other price concessions that would otherwise accrue to
35 insurers in connection with the dispensing or administration of a particular drug therapy.
36 SECTION 3.
37 Chapter 24 of Title 33 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to insurance
38 generally, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
39 "33-24-59.34.
