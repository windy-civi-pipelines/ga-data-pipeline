the 93rd, Alexander of the 66th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing April 2025 as Minority Health Month to encourage cholesterol screening; and
2 for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, high cholesterol, also called hypercholesterolemia, is the chronic presence of
4 high levels of cholesterol in the blood that can lead to cardiovascular disease, and even
5 cardiovascular events like heart attacks or strokes; and
6 WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that
7 cardiovascular disease is arguably the most underappreciated public health crisis of our time,
8 and someone in the United States has a heart attack every 40 seconds, yet about 80 percent
9 are preventable; and
10 WHEREAS, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or "bad" cholesterol, is an easily
11 modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, more than 80 million adults have high
12 LDL-C, and lower LDL-C is associated with a reduced risk of heart attack and stroke; and
13 WHEREAS, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States among racial and
14 ethnic minority populations; and

15 WHEREAS, cardiovascular disease accounts for more than 22,000 deaths in Georgia a year,
16 which is one in three deaths overall; and
17 WHEREAS, in 2019, African Americans were 30 percent more likely to die from heart
18 disease than non-Hispanic whites, and although African American adults are 30 percent more
19 likely to have high blood pressure, they are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have their
20 blood pressure under control; and
21 WHEREAS, African American women are nearly 50 percent more likely to have high blood
22 pressure, as compared to non-Hispanic white women; and
23 WHEREAS, the American Heart Association (AHA) has demonstrated that Hispanic
24 Americans are at exceptionally high risk for cardiovascular disease and coronary heart
25 disease, both of which can lead to a stroke or heart attack; and
26 WHEREAS, the AHA indicates that cardiovascular disease disproportionately affects
27 minority populations: 52.3 percent of Hispanic males and 42.7 percent of Hispanic females
28 over the age of 20 are affected by cardiovascular disease and 60.1 percent of Black males and
29 58.8 percent of Black females 20 years of age and older have cardiovascular disease; and
30 WHEREAS, the CDC found that one in three deaths in the United States is due to heart
31 disease and this results in more than $216 billion in healthcare cost; and
32 WHEREAS, nearly 60 percent of middle-aged Hispanic adults have high cholesterol, yet
33 only half are aware of this, according to a study published in the Journal of the American
34 Medical Association; and

35 WHEREAS, a study published in the American Journal of Preventative Cardiology found
36 cholesterol testing, an important preventive measure for reducing the risk of cardiovascular
37 disease, declined during the COVID-19 pandemic; and
38 WHEREAS, the resources needed to bend the curve in cardiovascular disease exist, yet 71
39 percent of hypercholesterolemia patients at high risk of a cardiovascular event never achieve
40 recommended LDL-C treatment guideline thresholds; and
41 WHEREAS, the LDL-C Action Summit, a consortium of the nation's leading cardiovascular
42 stakeholder groups, seeks to cut cardiovascular events in half by 2030; and
43 WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Million Hearts program seeks
44 to improve access and quality of care to reduce heart disease, stroke, and death; and
45 WHEREAS, all are encouraged to know their LDL-C level; and
46 WHEREAS, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority
47 Health recognizes April as National Minority Health Month; and
48 WHEREAS, the Georgia Department of Health is urged to update the state's cardiovascular
49 plan to accelerate quality improvements and measures to achieve improved health outcomes
50 for cardiovascular disease patients and develop campaigns to increase cholesterol screening
51 during the month of April; and
52 WHEREAS, providers are urged to treat all cardiovascular disease patients in accordance
53 with American College of Cardiology treatment guidelines.
