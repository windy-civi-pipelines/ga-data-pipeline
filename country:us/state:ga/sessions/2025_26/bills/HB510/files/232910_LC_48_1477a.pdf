17 assistance to a child who has not previously married or become emancipated, who is
18 enrolled in and attending a secondary school, and who has attained the age of majority

29 assistance to a child who is enrolled in and attending a technical school, vocational
30 school, college, university, or other institution of postsecondary education, provided that
31 such financial assistance shall not be required after a child attains 24 years of age. The
32 court shall require verification of such enrollment and attendance. In determining the
33 amount of such financial assistance, the court shall consider the amount of tuition as well
34 as additional fees and expenses related to such enrollment and attendance. The
35 provisions for child support provided in this paragraph may be enforced by either parent,
36 by any nonparent custodian, by a guardian appointed to receive child support for the child
