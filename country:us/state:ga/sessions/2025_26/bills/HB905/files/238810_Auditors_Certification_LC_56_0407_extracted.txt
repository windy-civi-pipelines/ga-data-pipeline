State Representative

SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
Dear Representative Richardson:
This bill would amend provisions relating to creditable service under the Georgia Judicial Retirement
System. Currently, persons who transfer from a position covered by the Employees' Retirement System
(ERS) to the Georgia Judicial Retirement System (JRS) have 90 days to make an election to transfer their
creditable service from the ERS to the JRS. Once the 90-day window has expired, the creditable service
cannot be transferred. This bill would provide a limited opportunity for members who did not meet the
90-day requirement to reconsider having their service transferred. If this legislation is enacted, all
members would have until December 31, 2026 to make such election regardless of the date they became a
member of the JRS. After December 31, 2026, the 90-day requirement would be reinstated.
Under the provisions of this bill, ERS would be required to transfer all employee and employer
contributions, with regular interest to the JRS. The member is authorized but not required to pay
additional amounts. Upon receipt of the funds, the JRS will credit the member with the number of years
of creditable service, not to exceed the actual years of service, as the amount so transferred will warrant
without creating any accrued liability to the JRS.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems
Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
