209 16-11-146.
210 (a)(1) The respondent may submit one written request for a hearing to vacate a risk

H. B. 453
- 9 -

221 evidence, including evidence of the considerations as provided in subsection (c) of Code

249 16-11-147.
250 (a) Upon issuance of a risk protection order or temporary ex parte risk protection order
251 under this part, the court shall order the respondent to surrender to the local law
252 enforcement agency all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent in the
253 respondent's custody, control, or possession, except as provided in Code Section
254 16-11-149, and any weapons carry license or renewal license issued under Code Section
255 16-11-129 held by the respondent.
256 (b) The law enforcement officer serving a risk protection order under this part, including
257 a temporary ex parte risk protection order, shall request that the respondent immediately
258 surrender all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent in his or her custody,
259 control, or possession and any weapons carry license or renewal license issued under Code
260 Section 16-11-129 held by the respondent. The law enforcement officer shall take
261 possession of such firearms, ammunition, and weapons carry license or renewal license so
262 surrendered. If personal service by a law enforcement officer is not possible or is not
263 required because the respondent was present at the risk protection order hearing, the
264 respondent shall surrender any firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent, and any
265 weapons carry license or renewal license issued under Code Section 16-11-129 held by the
266 respondent, in a safe manner to the control of the local law enforcement agency
267 immediately after being served with the order by service or immediately after the hearing
268 at which the respondent was present. Notwithstanding Code Sections 17-5-20, 17-5-21,
269 and 17-5-24, a law enforcement officer may seek a search warrant from a court of
270 competent jurisdiction to conduct a search for firearms or ammunition owned by the
271 respondent if the officer has probable cause to believe that there are firearms or
H. B. 453
- 11 -
25 LC 48 1380
272 ammunition owned by the respondent in the respondent's custody, control, or possession
273 which have not been surrendered.
274 (c) At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of any firearm
275 or ammunition owned by the respondent, or any weapons carry license or renewal license
276 issued under Code Section 16-11-129 held by the respondent, shall issue a receipt
277 identifying all firearms surrendered, the quantity and type of ammunition surrendered, and
278 any license surrendered and shall provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. Within
279 72 hours after service of the order, the law enforcement officer serving the order shall file
280 the original receipt with the court and shall ensure that his or her law enforcement agency
281 retains a copy of the receipt.
282 (d) Notwithstanding Code Sections 17-5-20 and 17-5-21, upon the sworn statement or
283 testimony of any person alleging that the respondent has failed to comply with the
284 surrender of firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent, as required by an order
285 issued under this part, the court shall determine whether probable cause exists to believe
286 that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms or ammunition owned by the
287 respondent in the respondent's custody, control, or possession. If the court finds that
288 probable cause exists, the court shall issue a warrant describing the firearms or ammunition
289 owned by the respondent and authorizing a search of the locations where such firearms or
290 ammunition are reasonably believed to be found and the seizure of any firearms or
291 ammunition owned by the respondent discovered pursuant to such search.
292 (e) If a person other than the respondent claims title to any firearms or ammunition
293 surrendered pursuant to this part and he or she is determined by the law enforcement
294 agency to be the lawful owner of the firearm or ammunition, the firearm or ammunition
295 shall be returned to him or her if:
296 (1) The lawful owner agrees to store the firearm or ammunition in a manner such that the
297 respondent does not have access to or control of the firearm or ammunition; and
298 (2) The firearm or ammunition is not otherwise unlawfully possessed by the owner.

299 (f) Upon the issuance of a risk protection order, the court shall order a new hearing date
300 and require the respondent to appear no later than three business days after the issuance of
301 the order. The court shall require proof that the respondent has surrendered any firearms
302 or ammunition owned by the respondent in the respondent's custody, control, or possession.
303 The court may cancel the hearing upon a satisfactory showing that the respondent is in
304 compliance with the risk protection order.
305 (g) All law enforcement agencies shall develop policies and procedures regarding the
306 acceptance, storage, and return of firearms, ammunition, or licenses required to be
307 surrendered under this part.
308 16-11-148.
309 (a) If a risk protection order is vacated or ends without extension, a law enforcement
310 agency holding a firearm or any ammunition owned by the respondent, or a weapons carry
311 license or renewal license issued under Code Section 16-11-129 held by the respondent,
312 that has been surrendered or seized pursuant to this part shall return such surrendered or
313 seized firearm, ammunition, or license as requested by a respondent only after confirming
314 through a background check that the respondent is currently eligible to own or possess
315 firearms and ammunition under federal and state law and after confirming with the court
316 that the risk protection order has been vacated or has ended without extension.
317 (b) A law enforcement agency shall provide notice to any family or household members
318 of the respondent before the return of any surrendered or seized firearm, ammunition, or
319 weapons carry license or renewal license to the respondent.
320 (c) Any firearm or ammunition surrendered by or seized from a respondent pursuant to
321 Code Section 16-11-147 which remains unclaimed by the lawful owner for one year after
322 an order to vacate the risk protection order or after the risk protection order ends without
323 extension shall be disposed of in accordance with Article 3 of Chapter 5 of Title 17.

325 A respondent may elect to transfer all firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent
326 that have been surrendered to or seized by a local law enforcement agency pursuant to
327 Code Section 16-11-147 to another person who is willing to receive the respondent's
328 firearms or ammunition. The law enforcement agency shall allow such a transfer only if
329 the chosen recipient:
330 (1) Currently is eligible to own or possess a firearm or ammunition under federal and
331 state law after confirmation through a background check;
332 (2) Attests to storing the firearms or ammunition in a manner such that the respondent
333 does not have access to or control of the firearms or ammunition until the risk protection
334 order against the respondent is vacated or ends without extension; and
335 (3) Attests not to transfer the firearms or ammunition back to the respondent until the

339 enter the order into the records of the Georgia Crime Information Center and National
340 Crime Information Center. The risk protection order shall remain in each system for the
341 period stated in the order, and the law enforcement agency may only remove an order from
342 the systems if it has been vacated or has ended without extension. Entry of the risk
343 protection order into the records of the Georgia Crime Information Center and National
344 Crime Information Center constitutes notice to all law enforcement agencies of the
345 existence of the order which shall be fully enforceable in any county in this state.
346 (b) The issuing court shall, within three business days after issuance of a risk protection
347 order or temporary ex parte risk protection order, forward all available identifying
348 information concerning the respondent, along with the date of issuance of the order, to the

H. B. 453
- 14 -
25 LC 48 1380
350 Information Center shall determine if the respondent has a weapons carry license or
351 firearm. If the respondent does have a weapons carry license or firearm, the Georgia Crime
352 Information Center shall immediately suspend the license.
353 (c) If a risk protection order is vacated before its end date, the clerk of the court shall, on
354 the day of the order to vacate, forward a copy of the order to vacate to the Georgia Crime
355 Information Center and the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order to
356 vacate. Upon receipt of the order to vacate, the law enforcement agency shall promptly

256 (b) The law enforcement officer serving a risk protection order under this part, including

258 surrender all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent in his or her custody,

260 Section 16-11-129 held by the respondent. The law enforcement officer shall take
261 possession of such firearms, ammunition, and weapons carry license or renewal license so
262 surrendered. If personal service by a law enforcement officer is not possible or is not
263 required because the respondent was present at the risk protection order hearing, the
264 respondent shall surrender any firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent, and any
265 weapons carry license or renewal license issued under Code Section 16-11-129 held by the
266 respondent, in a safe manner to the control of the local law enforcement agency
267 immediately after being served with the order by service or immediately after the hearing
268 at which the respondent was present. Notwithstanding Code Sections 17-5-20, 17-5-21,
269 and 17-5-24, a law enforcement officer may seek a search warrant from a court of
270 competent jurisdiction to conduct a search for firearms or ammunition owned by the

H. B. 453

273 which have not been surrendered.
274 (c) At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of any firearm
275 or ammunition owned by the respondent, or any weapons carry license or renewal license
276 issued under Code Section 16-11-129 held by the respondent, shall issue a receipt
277 identifying all firearms surrendered, the quantity and type of ammunition surrendered, and
278 any license surrendered and shall provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. Within
279 72 hours after service of the order, the law enforcement officer serving the order shall file
280 the original receipt with the court and shall ensure that his or her law enforcement agency

282 (d) Notwithstanding Code Sections 17-5-20 and 17-5-21, upon the sworn statement or
283 testimony of any person alleging that the respondent has failed to comply with the
284 surrender of firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent, as required by an order
285 issued under this part, the court shall determine whether probable cause exists to believe
286 that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms or ammunition owned by the
287 respondent in the respondent's custody, control, or possession. If the court finds that
288 probable cause exists, the court shall issue a warrant describing the firearms or ammunition
289 owned by the respondent and authorizing a search of the locations where such firearms or
290 ammunition are reasonably believed to be found and the seizure of any firearms or
291 ammunition owned by the respondent discovered pursuant to such search.
292 (e) If a person other than the respondent claims title to any firearms or ammunition
293 surrendered pursuant to this part and he or she is determined by the law enforcement
294 agency to be the lawful owner of the firearm or ammunition, the firearm or ammunition
295 shall be returned to him or her if:
296 (1) The lawful owner agrees to store the firearm or ammunition in a manner such that the
297 respondent does not have access to or control of the firearm or ammunition; and
298 (2) The firearm or ammunition is not otherwise unlawfully possessed by the owner.

312 that has been surrendered or seized pursuant to this part shall return such surrendered or
313 seized firearm, ammunition, or license as requested by a respondent only after confirming
314 through a background check that the respondent is currently eligible to own or possess
315 firearms and ammunition under federal and state law and after confirming with the court
316 that the risk protection order has been vacated or has ended without extension.
317 (b) A law enforcement agency shall provide notice to any family or household members
