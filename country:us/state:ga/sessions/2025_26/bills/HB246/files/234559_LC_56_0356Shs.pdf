122 (3)(2) An employer may charge a reasonable fee to cover actual costs incurred in
123 copying and furnishing documents pursuant to this subsection to a requesting law
124 enforcement agency, including retrieving and redacting costs, provided such amount shall

126 to prepare or create any document not already in the employer's possession at the time a
127 request for employment related information is received. Any employment related
128 information provided pursuant to this subsection that is not subject to public disclosure
129 while in the possession of a prior employer shall continue to be privileged and protected
130 from public disclosure as a record of the requesting law enforcement agency.

150 (6)(5) Nothing contained in this Code section subsection shall be construed so as to
151 require any person to provide self-incriminating information or otherwise to compel any
152 person to act in violation of his or her right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the
153 United States Constitution and Article I, Section I, Paragraph XVI of the Georgia
154 Constitution. It shall not be a violation of this Code section subsection for a person to fail
155 to provide requested information based on a claim that such information is
156 self-incriminating provided that notice of such claim is served in lieu of the requested
157 information. An action against such person to require disclosure on the grounds that the
158 claim of self-incrimination is not substantiated may be brought in the superior court of
159 the county of such party's residence or where such information is located."

161 This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law
