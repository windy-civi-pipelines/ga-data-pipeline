18 such person qualifies a form signed by the executive director of the Georgia Peace
19 Officer Standards and Training Council, or his or her designee, that attests and

21 such person assumes the office of sheriff shall be required to complete satisfactorily
22 the requirements for certification as a peace officer as provided in Chapter 8 of Title
23 35 within six months after such person takes office; provided, however, that an
24 extension of the time to complete such requirements may be granted by the Georgia
25 Peace Officer Standards and Training Council upon the presentation of evidence by
26 a sheriff that he or she was unable to complete the basic training course and
27 certification requirements due to illness, injury, military service, or other reasons
28 deemed sufficient by such council. The Georgia Peace Officer Standards and
29 Training Council shall make every effort to ensure that space is available for newly
30 elected sheriffs who are not certified or registered peace officers to attend the course
31 as soon as possible after such persons take office. Such council shall notify the
32 appropriate judge of the probate court whenever a newly elected sheriff who is not
33 certified fails to become certified as a peace officer pursuant to the requirements of
34 this subparagraph.
35 (2) Each person offering his or her candidacy for the office of sheriff shall, at the time
36 such person qualifies, swear or affirm before the officer before whom such person has

40 the requirements of subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of this subsection no later than
41 the close of business on the third business day following the close of such qualification
42 period. Any person who knowingly provides false information in executing the

47 deemed to have been met by any person who is currently serving as a duly qualified and
48 elected sheriff of one of the several counties of this state."
49 SECTION 2.
50 Chapter 8 of Title 35 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to employment and

53 preemployment attendance at basic training course and "employment related information"

83 examination as it deems necessary and appropriate. Any person with a degree from a
84 postsecondary institution accredited by a regional accrediting agency recognized by the
85 United States Department of Education shall be deemed to have met the requirements of

95 (c)(1) For purposes of this subsection (a) As used in this Code section, the term
96 'employment related information' means written information contained in a prior
97 employer's records or personnel files that relates to an applicant's, candidate's, or peace
98 officer's performance or behavior while employed by such prior employer, including
99 performance evaluations, records of disciplinary actions, and eligibility for rehire. Such
100 term shall not include information prohibited from disclosure by federal law or any
101 document not in the possession of the employer at the time a request for such information
102 is received.
103 (2)(b)(1) Where an investigation is conducted for the purpose of hiring, certifying, or
104 continuing the certification of a peace officer, an employer shall disclose employment
105 related information to the investigating law enforcement agency upon receiving a written
106 request from such agency. Disclosure shall only be required under this subsection if the
107 law enforcement agency's request is accompanied by a copy of a signed, notarized
108 statement from the applicant, candidate, or peace officer releasing and holding harmless
109 such employer from any and all liability for disclosing complete and accurate information
110 to the law enforcement agency.
111 (3)(2) An employer may charge a reasonable fee to cover actual costs incurred in
112 copying and furnishing documents pursuant to this subsection to a requesting law
113 enforcement agency, including retrieving and redacting costs, provided such amount shall
114 not exceed $25.00 or 25Â¢ per page, whichever is greater. No employer shall be required
115 to prepare or create any document not already in the employer's possession at the time a
116 request for employment related information is received. Any employment related
117 information provided pursuant to this subsection that is not subject to public disclosure
118 while in the possession of a prior employer shall continue to be privileged and protected
119 from public disclosure as a record of the requesting law enforcement agency.

25 LC 39 4539
120 (4)(3) No employer or law enforcement agency shall be subject to any civil liability for
121 any cause of action by virtue of disclosing complete and accurate information to a law
122 enforcement agency in good faith and without malice pursuant to this subsection. In any
123 such cause of action, malice or bad faith shall only be demonstrated by clear and
124 convincing evidence. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed so as to
125 affect or limit rights or remedies provided by federal law.
126 (5)(4) Before taking final action on an application for employment based, in whole or in
127 part, on any unfavorable employment related information received from a previous
128 employer, a law enforcement agency shall inform the applicant, candidate, or peace
129 officer that it has received such employment related information and that the applicant,
130 candidate, or peace officer may inspect and respond in writing to such information. Upon
131 the applicant's, candidate's, or peace officer's request, the law enforcement agency shall
132 allow him or her to inspect the employment related information and to submit a written
133 response to such information. The request for inspection shall be made within five
134 business days from the date that the applicant, candidate, or peace officer is notified of
135 the law enforcement agency's receipt of such employment related information. The
136 inspection shall occur not later than ten business days after said notification. Any
137 response to the employment related information shall be made by the applicant,
138 candidate, or peace officer not later than three business days after his or her inspection.
139 (6)(5) Nothing contained in this Code section subsection shall be construed so as to
140 require any person to provide self-incriminating information or otherwise to compel any
141 person to act in violation of his or her right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the
142 United States Constitution and Article I, Section I, Paragraph XVI of the Georgia
143 Constitution. It shall not be a violation of this Code section subsection for a person to fail
144 to provide requested information based on a claim that such information is
145 self-incriminating provided that notice of such claim is served in lieu of the requested
146 information. An action against such person to require disclosure on the grounds that the
H. B. 246

147 claim of self-incrimination is not substantiated may be brought in the superior court of
148 the county of such party's residence or where such information is located."
149 SECTION 3.
150 This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law
151 without such approval.
152 SECTION 4.
153 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
