House Resolution 128 (RULES COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE)
A RESOLUTION
1 Compensating individuals who have been exonerated following a wrongful conviction and
2 incarceration; and for other purposes.
3 PART I
4 Compensating Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins
5 WHEREAS, on the evening of January 11, 2000, while driving north on Highway 27 toward
6 Rome, Georgia, a man saw a small blue car driving erratically in front of him and interacting
7 aggressively with a truck, and shortly thereafter the man observed a flash and saw the truck
8 veer over the median and opposite lanes and then crash; and
9 WHEREAS, 20-year-old Mr. Isaac Dawkins was driving north in his truck on Highway 27
10 when he was shot in the head, causing Mr. Dawkins to crash his truck and later die from the
11 injuries he suffered; and
12 WHEREAS, on the same evening of January 11, 2000, 18-year-old Mr. Joseph Samuel
13 Watkins drove his white truck south from his home in Rome to the home of his girlfriend in
14 Cedartown, making several calls on his cell phone and passing the scene of Mr. Dawkins's
15 crash on the way; and
H. R. 128 (SUB)
- 1 -
25 LC 60 0129S
16 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins's cell phone records and testimonial evidence regarding a shot dog
17 were introduced at trial; and
18 WHEREAS, the prosecution and defense presented cell phone experts who agreed that there
19 was no possibility that Mr. Watkins's cellphone was located at or near the scene at the time
20 the shooter's blue car would have been located at the scene; and
21 WHEREAS, on July 2, 2001, a Floyd County jury convicted Mr. Watkins for the murder of
22 Mr. Dawkins; and
23 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins's co-defendant, who was the alleged shooter, was acquitted by a
24 different jury; and
25 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins continued to maintain his innocence and pursued appeals and other
26 post-conviction relief; and
27 WHEREAS, years later, the podcast Undisclosed and the Georgia Innocence Project learned
28 that during jury deliberations at Mr. Watkins's trial, one of the jurors had improperly
29 conducted her own "drive test" related to the cell phone records, causing her to erroneously
30 determine that Mr. Watkins could have been present at the crime scene, a determination
31 which she then shared with other jurors; and
32 WHEREAS, the Georgia Innocence Project discovered that although more than 15 years had
33 passed, a former medical examiner for GBI had retained a personal autopsy log from the
34 timeframe that he worked at the GBI, which included a previously unknown case number;
35 and
H. R. 128 (SUB)
- 2 -
25 LC 60 0129S
36 WHEREAS, the new case number assisted GBI in providing documents that established that
37 the bullet taken from the shot dog was of another caliber than the bullet used to shoot Mr.
38 Dawkins; and
39 WHEREAS, after discovering the evidence of the unauthorized juror drive test and the bullet,
40 Mr. Watkins filed a second petition for habeas corpus; and
41 WHEREAS, following a three-day evidentiary hearing in February and March, 2022, the
42 state habeas court granted the habeas corpus petition, overturning Mr. Watkins's convictions,
43 and granting him a new trial; and
44 WHEREAS, in a unanimous decision on December 20, 2022, the Supreme Court of Georgia
45 affirmed the state habeas court's grant of relief to Mr. Watkins, holding that the habeas court
46 did not err by concluding that Mr. Watkins showed that the juror's improper drive test during
47 deliberations, conducted to see whether Mr. Watkins could have been physically present at
48 the time and place Isaac Dawkins was shot, caused Mr. Watkins actual prejudice; and
49 WHEREAS, on January 3, 2023, Mr. Watkins was granted bond and released, but the
50 charges against him remained pending and the State could have sought to retry him; and
51 WHEREAS, on September 21, 2023, based on a review of all of the available evidence,
52 including the evidence presented at trial and new investigations, the State moved for entry
53 of an order of nolle prosequi, which the Superior Court of Floyd County granted, thereby
54 dismissing all the charges and officially exonerating Mr. Watkins; and
55 WHEREAS, the conviction, incarceration, and subsequent loss of liberty and other damages
56 suffered by Mr. Watkins occurred through no fault or negligence on his part, and it is only
H. R. 128 (SUB)
- 3 -
25 LC 60 0129S
57 fitting and proper that he be compensated for his losses for each year of wrongful
58 imprisonment; and
59 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only eleven states that does not have a statutory regime for
60 compensating innocent individuals who have been exonerated following wrongful conviction
61 and incarceration; and
62 WHEREAS, this lack of a statutory regime for compensation requires introduction of a
63 resolution to secure such compensation in Georgia.
64 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF
65 GEORGIA that the Department of Administrative Services is authorized and directed to pay
66 the sum of $1,688,527.40 to Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins as compensation as provided above.

111 Compensating Mr. Daryl Lee Clark
112 WHEREAS, on October 18, 1996, fifteen-year-old Mr. Brian Bowling tragically lost his life
113 while playing "Russian Roulette" with his friend, seventeen-year-old Mr. Cain Joshua Storey,
114 in the bedroom of Mr. Brian Bowling's home in Floyd County, Georgia; and
115 WHEREAS, several months later, seventeen-year-old Mr. Daryl Lee Clark, an acquaintance
116 of Mr. Brian Bowling, was arrested, and both he and Mr. Storey were charged with the
117 murder and conspiracy to commit the murder of Mr. Bowling; and
118 WHEREAS, one of the State's two key witnesses was Ms. Angela Bruce, who claimed that
119 during a party at her home after Mr. Bowling's death, she heard Mr. Storey say he had shot
120 and killed Mr. Bowling, and heard Mr. Clark say he was present at the time of the shooting;
121 and
122 WHEREAS, the second of the State's two key witnesses was Mr. Charlie Childers, a

128 and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to life imprisonment; and
129 WHEREAS, in late 2021, Ms. Bruce admitted for the first time to reporters and the Georgia
130 Innocence Project that her incriminating testimony concerning Mr. Clark's and Mr. Storey's
131 admissions was false; and
132 WHEREAS, the independent investigation further established for the first time that Mr.
133 Childers's translator at Mr. Clark's trial later questioned the accuracy of her own translation
134 of Mr. Childers's testimony, and regretted providing the translation at trial, because Mr.
135 Childers's manner of communication was not standard American Sign Language ("ASL"),
136 but instead a communication method unique to Mr. Childers and his former teacher (an ASL
137 expert who knew and understood Mr. Childers's unique communication method, having
138 worked with him from the time he has been a child); and
139 WHEREAS, through interpretation by a new translator (his former teacher) in 2021, Mr.

143 Extraordinary Motion for New Trial (EMNT) and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus; and

149 WHEREAS, after more than twenty-five years of wrongful imprisonment by the State of
150 Georgia, Mr. Clark was finally exonerated and freed from his incarceration on December 8,
151 2022; and
152 WHEREAS, the conviction, incarceration, and subsequent loss of liberty and other damages
153 suffered by Mr. Clark occurred through no fault or negligence on his part, and it is only
154 fitting, just, and proper that he be compensated for his losses for each year of wrongful
155 imprisonment; and
156 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only eleven states that does not have a statutory regime for
157 compensating innocent individuals who have been exonerated following wrongful conviction
158 and incarceration; and

House Resolution 128 (RULES COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE)
By: Representatives Dempsey of the 13th, Barton of the 5th, and Lumsden of the 12th
A RESOLUTION
1 Compensating individuals who have been exonerated following a wrongful conviction and
2 incarceration; and for other purposes.
3 PART I
4 Compensating Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins
5 WHEREAS, on the evening of January 11, 2000, while driving north on Highway 27 toward
6 Rome, Georgia, a man saw a small blue car driving erratically in front of him and interacting
7 aggressively with a truck, and shortly thereafter the man observed a flash and saw the truck
8 veer over the median and opposite lanes and then crash; and
9 WHEREAS, 20-year-old Mr. Isaac Dawkins was driving north in his truck on Highway 27
10 when he was shot in the head, causing Mr. Dawkins to crash his truck and later die from the
11 injuries he suffered; and
12 WHEREAS, on the same evening of January 11, 2000, 18-year-old Mr. Joseph Samuel
13 Watkins drove his white truck south from his home in Rome to the home of his girlfriend in
14 Cedartown, making several calls on his cell phone and passing the scene of Mr. Dawkins's
15 crash on the way; and
H. R. 128 (SUB)
- 1 -

25 LC 60 0129S
16 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins's cell phone records and testimonial evidence regarding a shot dog
17 were introduced at trial; and
18 WHEREAS, the prosecution and defense presented cell phone experts who agreed that there
19 was no possibility that Mr. Watkins's cellphone was located at or near the scene at the time
20 the shooter's blue car would have been located at the scene; and
21 WHEREAS, on July 2, 2001, a Floyd County jury convicted Mr. Watkins for the murder of
22 Mr. Dawkins; and
23 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins's co-defendant, who was the alleged shooter, was acquitted by a
24 different jury; and
25 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins continued to maintain his innocence and pursued appeals and other
26 post-conviction relief; and
27 WHEREAS, years later, the podcast Undisclosed and the Georgia Innocence Project learned
28 that during jury deliberations at Mr. Watkins's trial, one of the jurors had improperly
29 conducted her own "drive test" related to the cell phone records, causing her to erroneously
30 determine that Mr. Watkins could have been present at the crime scene, a determination
31 which she then shared with other jurors; and
32 WHEREAS, the Georgia Innocence Project discovered that although more than 15 years had
33 passed, a former medical examiner for GBI had retained a personal autopsy log from the
34 timeframe that he worked at the GBI, which included a previously unknown case number;
35 and
H. R. 128 (SUB)
- 2 -

25 LC 60 0129S
36 WHEREAS, the new case number assisted GBI in providing documents that established that
37 the bullet taken from the shot dog was of another caliber than the bullet used to shoot Mr.
38 Dawkins; and
39 WHEREAS, after discovering the evidence of the unauthorized juror drive test and the bullet,
40 Mr. Watkins filed a second petition for habeas corpus; and
41 WHEREAS, following a three-day evidentiary hearing in February and March, 2022, the
42 state habeas court granted the habeas corpus petition, overturning Mr. Watkins's convictions,
43 and granting him a new trial; and
44 WHEREAS, in a unanimous decision on December 20, 2022, the Supreme Court of Georgia
45 affirmed the state habeas court's grant of relief to Mr. Watkins, holding that the habeas court
46 did not err by concluding that Mr. Watkins showed that the juror's improper drive test during
47 deliberations, conducted to see whether Mr. Watkins could have been physically present at
48 the time and place Isaac Dawkins was shot, caused Mr. Watkins actual prejudice; and
49 WHEREAS, on January 3, 2023, Mr. Watkins was granted bond and released, but the
50 charges against him remained pending and the State could have sought to retry him; and
51 WHEREAS, on September 21, 2023, based on a review of all of the available evidence,
52 including the evidence presented at trial and new investigations, the State moved for entry
53 of an order of nolle prosequi, which the Superior Court of Floyd County granted, thereby
54 dismissing all the charges and officially exonerating Mr. Watkins; and
55 WHEREAS, the conviction, incarceration, and subsequent loss of liberty and other damages
56 suffered by Mr. Watkins occurred through no fault or negligence on his part, and it is only
H. R. 128 (SUB)
- 3 -

25 LC 60 0129S
57 fitting and proper that he be compensated for his losses for each year of wrongful
58 imprisonment; and
59 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only eleven states that does not have a statutory regime for
60 compensating innocent individuals who have been exonerated following wrongful conviction
61 and incarceration; and
62 WHEREAS, this lack of a statutory regime for compensation requires introduction of a
63 resolution to secure such compensation in Georgia.
64 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF
65 GEORGIA that the Department of Administrative Services is authorized and directed to pay
66 the sum of $1,688,527.40 to Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins as compensation as provided above.

69 the state arising out of or related to any and all facts in connection with Mr. Watkins's
70 wrongful conviction and incarceration and shall be paid subject to the provisions of this
71 resolution.
72 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, prior to the payment of the compensation, Mr. Watkins
73 shall sign a release and waiver which shall release, satisfy, quitclaim, and forever discharge
74 any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, and damages, of every kind and nature
75 whatsoever, past, present, or future, whether known or unknown, specifically including, but
76 not limited to, all claims asserted or which could have been asserted, on behalf of himself and

89 former members, officers, employees, or agents of the state or any branch thereof in state or
90 federal court requesting compensation arising out of or related to any and all facts in
91 connection to his wrongful conviction and incarceration.
92 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that said sum shall be paid in the form of an annuity in equal
93 monthly installments over a ten-year period of time beginning one year after an initial lump
94 sum payment of $535,000.00. The remainder of said sum shall be paid immediately into a
95 commercial annuity account bearing interest at the prevailing market rate, payable in equal
96 monthly installments over a ten-year period of time beginning in 2026 with interest payable
97 to Mr. Watkins. Compensation paid pursuant to this resolution is intended to provide the
98 sole, final, and exclusive compensation by the state and any and all offices, authorities,
99 agencies, departments, units, divisions, instrumentalities, institutions, commissions, boards,
100 branches, and entities of the state, and any and all current and former members, officers,

102 and future claims arising out of or related to any and all facts in connection with Mr.
103 Watkins's wrongful conviction and incarceration. No estate of or personal representative for

106 Georgia with respect to any and all future payments with respect to the annuity shall continue

109 resolution shall be excluded from his taxable net income for state income tax purposes.
110 PART II
111 Compensating Mr. Daryl Lee Clark
112 WHEREAS, on October 18, 1996, fifteen-year-old Mr. Brian Bowling tragically lost his life
113 while playing "Russian Roulette" with his friend, seventeen-year-old Mr. Cain Joshua Storey,
114 in the bedroom of Mr. Brian Bowling's home in Floyd County, Georgia; and
115 WHEREAS, several months later, seventeen-year-old Mr. Daryl Lee Clark, an acquaintance
116 of Mr. Brian Bowling, was arrested, and both he and Mr. Storey were charged with the
117 murder and conspiracy to commit the murder of Mr. Bowling; and
118 WHEREAS, one of the State's two key witnesses was Ms. Angela Bruce, who claimed that
119 during a party at her home after Mr. Bowling's death, she heard Mr. Storey say he had shot
120 and killed Mr. Bowling, and heard Mr. Clark say he was present at the time of the shooting;
121 and
122 WHEREAS, the second of the State's two key witnesses was Mr. Charlie Childers, a
123 functionally illiterate and severely hearing and speech impaired man with limited and unique
124 sign language skills, who testified that he had seen a person named "Daryl" flee from Mr.

125 Bowling's yard immediately after the shooting and identified Mr. Clark in a police photo
126 lineup; and
127 WHEREAS, on January 19, 1998, Mr. Clark and Mr. Storey were both convicted of murder
128 and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to life imprisonment; and
129 WHEREAS, in late 2021, Ms. Bruce admitted for the first time to reporters and the Georgia
130 Innocence Project that her incriminating testimony concerning Mr. Clark's and Mr. Storey's
131 admissions was false; and
132 WHEREAS, the independent investigation further established for the first time that Mr.
133 Childers's translator at Mr. Clark's trial later questioned the accuracy of her own translation
134 of Mr. Childers's testimony, and regretted providing the translation at trial, because Mr.
135 Childers's manner of communication was not standard American Sign Language ("ASL"),
136 but instead a communication method unique to Mr. Childers and his former teacher (an ASL
137 expert who knew and understood Mr. Childers's unique communication method, having
138 worked with him from the time he has been a child); and
139 WHEREAS, through interpretation by a new translator (his former teacher) in 2021, Mr.

143 Extraordinary Motion for New Trial (EMNT) and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus; and

145 the Superior Court of Floyd County; and
H. R. 128 (SUB)
- 7 -

25 LC 60 0129S
146 WHEREAS, on that same date, the District Attorney's Office for the Rome Judicial Circuit
147 sought, and a Floyd County Superior Court Judge granted, dismissal of all charges against
148 Mr. Clark based upon evidentiary considerations; and
149 WHEREAS, after more than twenty-five years of wrongful imprisonment by the State of
150 Georgia, Mr. Clark was finally exonerated and freed from his incarceration on December 8,
151 2022; and
152 WHEREAS, the conviction, incarceration, and subsequent loss of liberty and other damages
153 suffered by Mr. Clark occurred through no fault or negligence on his part, and it is only
154 fitting, just, and proper that he be compensated for his losses for each year of wrongful
155 imprisonment; and
156 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only eleven states that does not have a statutory regime for
157 compensating innocent individuals who have been exonerated following wrongful conviction
158 and incarceration; and
159 WHEREAS, this lack of a statutory regime for compensation requires introduction of a
160 resolution to secure such compensation in Georgia.
161 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF
162 GEORGIA that the Department of Administrative Services is authorized and directed to pay
