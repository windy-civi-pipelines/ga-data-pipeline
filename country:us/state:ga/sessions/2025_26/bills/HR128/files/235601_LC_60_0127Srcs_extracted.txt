WITHDRAWN
A RESOLUTION
1 Compensating individuals who have been exonerated following a wrongful conviction and
2 incarceration; and for other purposes.
3 PART I
4 Compensating Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins
5 WHEREAS, on the evening of January 11, 2000, while driving north on Highway 27 toward
6 Rome, Georgia, a man saw a small blue car driving erratically in front of him and interacting
7 aggressively with a truck, and shortly thereafter the man observed a flash and saw the truck
8 veer over the median and opposite lanes and then crash; and
9 WHEREAS, 20-year-old Mr. Isaac Dawkins was driving north in his truck on Highway 27
10 when he was shot in the head, causing Mr. Dawkins to crash his truck and later die from the
11 injuries he suffered; and
12 WHEREAS, on the same evening of January 11, 2000, 18-year-old Mr. Joseph Samuel
13 Watkins drove his white truck south from his home in Rome to the home of his girlfriend in
14 Cedartown, making several calls on his cell phone and passing the scene of Mr. Dawkins's
15 crash on the way; and
- 1 -
LC 60 0127S
16 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins's cell phone records and testimonial evidence regarding a shot dog
17 were introduced at trial; and
18 WHEREAS, the prosecution and defense presented cell phone experts who agreed that there
19 was no possibility that Mr. Watkins's cellphone was located at or near the scene at the time
20 the shooter's blue car would have been located at the scene; and
21 WHEREAS, on July 2, 2001, a Floyd County jury convicted Mr. Watkins for the murder of
22 Mr. Dawkins; and
23 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins's co-defendant, who was the alleged shooter, was acquitted by a
24 different jury; and
25 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins continued to maintain his innocence and pursued appeals and other
26 post-conviction relief; and
27 WHEREAS, years later, the podcast Undisclosed and the Georgia Innocence Project learned
28 that during jury deliberations at Mr. Watkins's trial, one of the jurors had improperly
29 conducted her own "drive test" related to the cell phone records, causing her to erroneously
30 determine that Mr. Watkins could have been present at the crime scene, a determination
31 which she then shared with other jurors; and
32 WHEREAS, the Georgia Innocence Project discovered that although more than 15 years had
33 passed, a former medical examiner for GBI had retained a personal autopsy log from the
34 timeframe that he worked at the GBI, which included a previously unknown case number;
35 and
- 2 -
LC 60 0127S
36 WHEREAS, the new case number assisted GBI in providing documents that established that
37 the bullet taken from the shot dog was of another caliber than the bullet used to shoot Mr.
38 Dawkins; and
39 WHEREAS, after discovering the evidence of the unauthorized juror drive test and the bullet,
40 Mr. Watkins filed a second petition for habeas corpus; and
41 WHEREAS, following a three-day evidentiary hearing in February and March, 2022, the
42 state habeas court granted the habeas corpus petition, overturning Mr. Watkins's convictions,
43 and granting him a new trial; and
44 WHEREAS, in a unanimous decision on December 20, 2022, the Supreme Court of Georgia
45 affirmed the state habeas court's grant of relief to Mr. Watkins, holding that the habeas court
46 did not err by concluding that Mr. Watkins showed that the juror's improper drive test during
47 deliberations, conducted to see whether Mr. Watkins could have been physically present at
48 the time and place Isaac Dawkins was shot, caused Mr. Watkins actual prejudice; and
49 WHEREAS, on January 3, 2023, Mr. Watkins was granted bond and released, but the
50 charges against him remained pending and the State could have sought to retry him; and
51 WHEREAS, on September 21, 2023, based on a review of all of the available evidence,
52 including the evidence presented at trial and new investigations, the State moved for entry
53 of an order of nolle prosequi, which the Superior Court of Floyd County granted, thereby
54 dismissing all the charges and officially exonerating Mr. Watkins; and
55 WHEREAS, the conviction, incarceration, and subsequent loss of liberty and other damages
56 suffered by Mr. Watkins occurred through no fault or negligence on his part, and it is only
- 3 -
LC 60 0127S
57 fitting and proper that he be compensated for his losses for each year of wrongful
58 imprisonment; and
59 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only eleven states that does not have a statutory regime for
60 compensating innocent individuals who have been exonerated following wrongful conviction
61 and incarceration; and
62 WHEREAS, this lack of a statutory regime for compensation requires introduction of a
63 resolution to secure such compensation in Georgia.
64 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF
65 GEORGIA that the Department of Administrative Services is authorized and directed to pay
66 the sum of $1,688,527.40 to Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins as compensation as provided above.

90 employees, or agents of the state or any branch or political subdivisions thereof in state or
91 federal court requesting compensation arising out of or related to any and all facts in
92 connection to his wrongful conviction and incarceration.
93 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that said sum shall be paid in the form of an annuity in equal
94 monthly installments over a ten-year period of time beginning one year after an initial lump

96 commercial annuity account bearing interest at the prevailing market rate, payable in equal
97 monthly installments over a ten-year period of time beginning in 2026 with interest payable

100 agencies, departments, units, divisions, subdivisions, instrumentalities, institutions,
101 commissions, boards, branches, and entities of the state, and any political subdivisions
102 thereof, and any and all current and former members, officers, employees, or agents of the
103 State of Georgia or any branches or political subdivisions thereof, for any and all present and
104 future claims arising out of or related to any and all facts in connection with Mr. Watkins's

LC 60 0127S
105 wrongful conviction and incarceration. No estate of or personal representative for Mr.

112 PART II
113 Compensating Mr. Daryl Lee Clark
114 WHEREAS, on October 18, 1996, fifteen-year-old Mr. Brian Bowling tragically lost his life
115 while playing "Russian Roulette" with his friend, seventeen-year-old Mr. Cain Joshua Storey,
116 in the bedroom of Mr. Brian Bowling's home in Floyd County, Georgia; and
117 WHEREAS, several months later, seventeen-year-old Mr. Daryl Lee Clark, an acquaintance
118 of Mr. Brian Bowling, was arrested, and both he and Mr. Storey were charged with the
119 murder and conspiracy to commit the murder of Mr. Bowling; and
120 WHEREAS, one of the State's two key witnesses was Ms. Angela Bruce, who claimed that
121 during a party at her home after Mr. Bowling's death, she heard Mr. Storey say he had shot
122 and killed Mr. Bowling, and heard Mr. Clark say he was present at the time of the shooting;
123 and
124 WHEREAS, the second of the State's two key witnesses was Mr. Charlie Childers, a
125 functionally illiterate and severely hearing and speech impaired man with limited and unique
- 6 -
LC 60 0127S
126 sign language skills, who testified that he had seen a person named "Daryl" flee from Mr.
127 Bowling's yard immediately after the shooting and identified Mr. Clark in a police photo
128 lineup; and
129 WHEREAS, on January 19, 1998, Mr. Clark and Mr. Storey were both convicted of murder
130 and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to life imprisonment; and
131 WHEREAS, in late 2021, Ms. Bruce admitted for the first time to reporters and the Georgia
132 Innocence Project that her incriminating testimony concerning Mr. Clark's and Mr. Storey's
133 admissions was false; and
134 WHEREAS, the independent investigation further established for the first time that Mr.
135 Childers's translator at Mr. Clark's trial later questioned the accuracy of her own translation
136 of Mr. Childers's testimony, and regretted providing the translation at trial, because Mr.
137 Childers's manner of communication was not standard American Sign Language ("ASL"),
138 but instead a communication method unique to Mr. Childers and his former teacher (an ASL
139 expert who knew and understood Mr. Childers's unique communication method, having
140 worked with him from the time he has been a child); and
141 WHEREAS, through interpretation by a new translator (his former teacher) in 2021, Mr.
142 Childers indicated that testimony given by him over 20 years earlier had not been accurately
143 interpreted to the jury; and
144 WHEREAS, on September 16, 2022, Georgia Innocence Project lawyers filed an
145 Extraordinary Motion for New Trial (EMNT) and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus; and
- 7 -
LC 60 0127S
146 WHEREAS, on December 8, 2022, Mr. Clark's convictions were overturned and vacated by
147 the Superior Court of Floyd County; and
148 WHEREAS, on that same date, the District Attorney's Office for the Rome Judicial Circuit
149 sought, and a Floyd County Superior Court Judge granted, dismissal of all charges against
150 Mr. Clark based upon evidentiary considerations; and
151 WHEREAS, after more than twenty-five years of wrongful imprisonment by the State of
152 Georgia, Mr. Clark was finally exonerated and freed from his incarceration on December 8,
153 2022; and
154 WHEREAS, the conviction, incarceration, and subsequent loss of liberty and other damages
155 suffered by Mr. Clark occurred through no fault or negligence on his part, and it is only
156 fitting, just, and proper that he be compensated for his losses for each year of wrongful
157 imprisonment; and
158 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only eleven states that does not have a statutory regime for
159 compensating innocent individuals who have been exonerated following wrongful conviction
160 and incarceration; and
161 WHEREAS, this lack of a statutory regime for compensation requires introduction of a
162 resolution to secure such compensation in Georgia.

177 commissions, boards, branches, and entities of the State of Georgia or any political
178 subdivisions thereof, and any and all current and former members, officers, employees, and

LC 60 0127S
WITHDRAWN
The House Committee on Rules offers the following substitute to HR 128:
A RESOLUTION
1 Compensating individuals who have been exonerated following a wrongful conviction and
2 incarceration; and for other purposes.
3 PART I
4 Compensating Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins
5 WHEREAS, on the evening of January 11, 2000, while driving north on Highway 27 toward
6 Rome, Georgia, a man saw a small blue car driving erratically in front of him and interacting
7 aggressively with a truck, and shortly thereafter the man observed a flash and saw the truck
8 veer over the median and opposite lanes and then crash; and
9 WHEREAS, 20-year-old Mr. Isaac Dawkins was driving north in his truck on Highway 27
10 when he was shot in the head, causing Mr. Dawkins to crash his truck and later die from the
11 injuries he suffered; and
12 WHEREAS, on the same evening of January 11, 2000, 18-year-old Mr. Joseph Samuel
13 Watkins drove his white truck south from his home in Rome to the home of his girlfriend in
14 Cedartown, making several calls on his cell phone and passing the scene of Mr. Dawkins's
15 crash on the way; and
- 1 -

LC 60 0127S
16 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins's cell phone records and testimonial evidence regarding a shot dog
17 were introduced at trial; and
18 WHEREAS, the prosecution and defense presented cell phone experts who agreed that there
19 was no possibility that Mr. Watkins's cellphone was located at or near the scene at the time
20 the shooter's blue car would have been located at the scene; and
21 WHEREAS, on July 2, 2001, a Floyd County jury convicted Mr. Watkins for the murder of
22 Mr. Dawkins; and
23 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins's co-defendant, who was the alleged shooter, was acquitted by a
24 different jury; and
25 WHEREAS, Mr. Watkins continued to maintain his innocence and pursued appeals and other
26 post-conviction relief; and
27 WHEREAS, years later, the podcast Undisclosed and the Georgia Innocence Project learned
28 that during jury deliberations at Mr. Watkins's trial, one of the jurors had improperly
29 conducted her own "drive test" related to the cell phone records, causing her to erroneously
30 determine that Mr. Watkins could have been present at the crime scene, a determination
31 which she then shared with other jurors; and
32 WHEREAS, the Georgia Innocence Project discovered that although more than 15 years had
33 passed, a former medical examiner for GBI had retained a personal autopsy log from the
34 timeframe that he worked at the GBI, which included a previously unknown case number;
35 and
- 2 -

LC 60 0127S
36 WHEREAS, the new case number assisted GBI in providing documents that established that
37 the bullet taken from the shot dog was of another caliber than the bullet used to shoot Mr.
38 Dawkins; and
39 WHEREAS, after discovering the evidence of the unauthorized juror drive test and the bullet,
40 Mr. Watkins filed a second petition for habeas corpus; and
41 WHEREAS, following a three-day evidentiary hearing in February and March, 2022, the
42 state habeas court granted the habeas corpus petition, overturning Mr. Watkins's convictions,
43 and granting him a new trial; and
44 WHEREAS, in a unanimous decision on December 20, 2022, the Supreme Court of Georgia
45 affirmed the state habeas court's grant of relief to Mr. Watkins, holding that the habeas court
46 did not err by concluding that Mr. Watkins showed that the juror's improper drive test during
47 deliberations, conducted to see whether Mr. Watkins could have been physically present at
48 the time and place Isaac Dawkins was shot, caused Mr. Watkins actual prejudice; and
49 WHEREAS, on January 3, 2023, Mr. Watkins was granted bond and released, but the
50 charges against him remained pending and the State could have sought to retry him; and
51 WHEREAS, on September 21, 2023, based on a review of all of the available evidence,
52 including the evidence presented at trial and new investigations, the State moved for entry
53 of an order of nolle prosequi, which the Superior Court of Floyd County granted, thereby
54 dismissing all the charges and officially exonerating Mr. Watkins; and
55 WHEREAS, the conviction, incarceration, and subsequent loss of liberty and other damages
56 suffered by Mr. Watkins occurred through no fault or negligence on his part, and it is only
- 3 -

LC 60 0127S
57 fitting and proper that he be compensated for his losses for each year of wrongful
58 imprisonment; and
59 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only eleven states that does not have a statutory regime for
60 compensating innocent individuals who have been exonerated following wrongful conviction
61 and incarceration; and
62 WHEREAS, this lack of a statutory regime for compensation requires introduction of a
63 resolution to secure such compensation in Georgia.
64 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF
65 GEORGIA that the Department of Administrative Services is authorized and directed to pay
66 the sum of $1,688,527.40 to Mr. Joseph Samuel Watkins as compensation as provided above.
67 Said sum shall be paid from funds appropriated to or available to the Department of
68 Administrative Services and shall be in full and complete satisfaction of all claims against
69 the state arising out of or related to any and all facts in connection with Mr. Watkins's
70 wrongful conviction and incarceration and shall be paid subject to the provisions of this
71 resolution.
72 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, prior to the payment of the compensation, Mr. Watkins
73 shall sign a release and waiver which shall release, satisfy, quitclaim, and forever discharge
74 any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, and damages, of every kind and nature
75 whatsoever, past, present, or future, whether known or unknown, specifically including, but
76 not limited to, all claims asserted or which could have been asserted, on behalf of himself and
77 his heirs, successors, and assigns, forever releasing the state and all offices, authorities,
78 agencies, departments, units, divisions, subdivisions, instrumentalities, institutions,
79 commissions, boards, branches, and entities of the State of Georgia or any political
- 4 -

80 subdivisions thereof, and any and all current and former members, officers, employees, and
81 agents of the state, or any branch or political subdivisions thereof, from all past, present, or
82 future claims that Mr. Watkins or his heirs, successors, and assigns may have against such
83 individuals or entities in any capacity arising out of or related to any and all facts in
84 connection with his wrongful conviction and incarceration.
85 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Mr. Watkins shall not be authorized to receive
86 compensation pursuant to this resolution if he has a lawsuit pending against the state or any
87 offices, authorities, agencies, departments, units, divisions, subdivisions, instrumentalities,
88 institutions, commissions, boards, branches, or entities of the State of Georgia or any
89 political subdivisions thereof, or against any current and former members, officers,
90 employees, or agents of the state or any branch or political subdivisions thereof in state or
91 federal court requesting compensation arising out of or related to any and all facts in
92 connection to his wrongful conviction and incarceration.
93 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that said sum shall be paid in the form of an annuity in equal
94 monthly installments over a ten-year period of time beginning one year after an initial lump
95 sum payment of $535,000.00. The remainder of said sum shall be paid immediately into a
96 commercial annuity account bearing interest at the prevailing market rate, payable in equal
97 monthly installments over a ten-year period of time beginning in 2026 with interest payable
98 to Mr. Watkins. Compensation paid pursuant to this resolution is intended to provide the
99 sole, final, and exclusive compensation by the state and any and all offices, authorities,
100 agencies, departments, units, divisions, subdivisions, instrumentalities, institutions,
101 commissions, boards, branches, and entities of the state, and any political subdivisions
102 thereof, and any and all current and former members, officers, employees, or agents of the
103 State of Georgia or any branches or political subdivisions thereof, for any and all present and
104 future claims arising out of or related to any and all facts in connection with Mr. Watkins's
- 5 -

LC 60 0127S
105 wrongful conviction and incarceration. No estate of or personal representative for Mr.
106 Watkins shall be entitled to requisition or otherwise seek compensation on behalf of Mr.
107 Watkins. Upon the death of Mr. Watkins, all payments and all obligations of the State of
108 Georgia with respect to any and all future payments with respect to the annuity shall continue
109 to be made to his estate or heirs.
110 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any amount received by Mr. Watkins pursuant to this
111 resolution shall be excluded from his taxable net income for state income tax purposes.
112 PART II
113 Compensating Mr. Daryl Lee Clark
114 WHEREAS, on October 18, 1996, fifteen-year-old Mr. Brian Bowling tragically lost his life
115 while playing "Russian Roulette" with his friend, seventeen-year-old Mr. Cain Joshua Storey,
116 in the bedroom of Mr. Brian Bowling's home in Floyd County, Georgia; and
117 WHEREAS, several months later, seventeen-year-old Mr. Daryl Lee Clark, an acquaintance
118 of Mr. Brian Bowling, was arrested, and both he and Mr. Storey were charged with the
119 murder and conspiracy to commit the murder of Mr. Bowling; and
120 WHEREAS, one of the State's two key witnesses was Ms. Angela Bruce, who claimed that
121 during a party at her home after Mr. Bowling's death, she heard Mr. Storey say he had shot
122 and killed Mr. Bowling, and heard Mr. Clark say he was present at the time of the shooting;
123 and
124 WHEREAS, the second of the State's two key witnesses was Mr. Charlie Childers, a
125 functionally illiterate and severely hearing and speech impaired man with limited and unique
- 6 -

LC 60 0127S
126 sign language skills, who testified that he had seen a person named "Daryl" flee from Mr.
127 Bowling's yard immediately after the shooting and identified Mr. Clark in a police photo
128 lineup; and
129 WHEREAS, on January 19, 1998, Mr. Clark and Mr. Storey were both convicted of murder
130 and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to life imprisonment; and
131 WHEREAS, in late 2021, Ms. Bruce admitted for the first time to reporters and the Georgia
132 Innocence Project that her incriminating testimony concerning Mr. Clark's and Mr. Storey's
133 admissions was false; and
134 WHEREAS, the independent investigation further established for the first time that Mr.
135 Childers's translator at Mr. Clark's trial later questioned the accuracy of her own translation
136 of Mr. Childers's testimony, and regretted providing the translation at trial, because Mr.
137 Childers's manner of communication was not standard American Sign Language ("ASL"),
138 but instead a communication method unique to Mr. Childers and his former teacher (an ASL
139 expert who knew and understood Mr. Childers's unique communication method, having
140 worked with him from the time he has been a child); and
141 WHEREAS, through interpretation by a new translator (his former teacher) in 2021, Mr.
142 Childers indicated that testimony given by him over 20 years earlier had not been accurately
143 interpreted to the jury; and
144 WHEREAS, on September 16, 2022, Georgia Innocence Project lawyers filed an
145 Extraordinary Motion for New Trial (EMNT) and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus; and
- 7 -

LC 60 0127S
146 WHEREAS, on December 8, 2022, Mr. Clark's convictions were overturned and vacated by
147 the Superior Court of Floyd County; and
148 WHEREAS, on that same date, the District Attorney's Office for the Rome Judicial Circuit
149 sought, and a Floyd County Superior Court Judge granted, dismissal of all charges against
150 Mr. Clark based upon evidentiary considerations; and
151 WHEREAS, after more than twenty-five years of wrongful imprisonment by the State of
152 Georgia, Mr. Clark was finally exonerated and freed from his incarceration on December 8,
153 2022; and
154 WHEREAS, the conviction, incarceration, and subsequent loss of liberty and other damages
155 suffered by Mr. Clark occurred through no fault or negligence on his part, and it is only
156 fitting, just, and proper that he be compensated for his losses for each year of wrongful
157 imprisonment; and
158 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only eleven states that does not have a statutory regime for
159 compensating innocent individuals who have been exonerated following wrongful conviction
160 and incarceration; and
161 WHEREAS, this lack of a statutory regime for compensation requires introduction of a
162 resolution to secure such compensation in Georgia.
163 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF
164 GEORGIA that the Department of Administrative Services is authorized and directed to pay
165 the sum of $1,917,128.00 to Mr. Daryl Lee Clark as compensation as provided above. Said
166 sum shall be paid from funds appropriated to or available to the Department of

169 conviction and incarceration and shall be paid subject to the provisions of this resolution.
170 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, prior to the payment of the compensation, Mr. Clark
171 shall sign a release and waiver which shall release, satisfy, quitclaim, and forever discharge
172 any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, and damages, of every kind and nature
173 whatsoever, past, present, or future, whether known or unknown, specifically including, but
174 not limited to, all claims asserted or which could have been asserted, on behalf of himself and
175 his heirs, successors, and assigns, forever releasing the state and all offices, authorities,
176 agencies, departments, units, divisions, subdivisions, instrumentalities, institutions,
177 commissions, boards, branches, and entities of the State of Georgia or any political
178 subdivisions thereof, and any and all current and former members, officers, employees, and
179 agents of the state, or any branch or political subdivisions thereof, from all past, present, or
180 future claims that Mr. Clark or his heirs, successors, and assigns may have against such
181 individuals or entities in any capacity arising out of or related to any and all facts in
182 connection with his wrongful conviction and incarceration.
183 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Mr. Clark shall not be authorized to receive
184 compensation pursuant to this resolution if he has a lawsuit pending against the state or any
185 offices, authorities, agencies, departments, units, divisions, subdivisions, instrumentalities,
