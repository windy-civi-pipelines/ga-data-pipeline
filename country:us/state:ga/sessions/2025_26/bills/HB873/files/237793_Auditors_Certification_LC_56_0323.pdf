SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
House Bill (LC 56 0323)
Dear Representative Townsend:
This bill would amend provisions relating to retirement allowances under the Teachers Retirement
System of Georgia. Under the provisions of this bill, the Department of Education would be
authorized to employ a beneficiary of the Teachers Retirement System. Such beneficiary would be
eligible to continue receiving their retirement allowance and any postretirement benefit adjustments
for which they are eligible. This provision shall not apply to any beneficiary who becomes an
employee of any school operated by the Department of Education. It should be noted that this bill
does not specify the duration of the break in service that would be required before the beneficiary may
become employed by the Department of Education.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems
Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
