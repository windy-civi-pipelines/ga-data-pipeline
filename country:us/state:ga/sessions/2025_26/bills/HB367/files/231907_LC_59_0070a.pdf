H. B. 367
- 1 -

25 LC 59 0070
14 (1) Millions of Africans and their descendants were enslaved in the 13 American
15 colonies and the United States, including the Georgia colony and the State of Georgia,
16 from 1619 through 1865;
17 (2) The institution of chattel slavery was constitutionally and statutorily sanctioned by
18 the United States government from 1789 through 1865;
19 (3) The chattel slavery that flourished in Georgia and the United States constituted an
20 immoral and inhumane deprivation of each African's life, liberty, African citizenship
21 rights, and cultural heritage, and denied them the fruits of their own labor;
22 (4) A preponderance of scholarly, legal, community evidentiary documentation, and
23 popular culture markers constitute the basis for inquiry into the ongoing effects of the
24 institution of chattel slavery and its legacy of persistent systemic structures of
25 discrimination on the living descendants of chattel slavery and society in Georgia and the
26 United States;
27 (5) Following the abolition of chattel slavery, governments at the federal, state, and local
28 levels continued to perpetuate, condone, and often profit from practices that continued
29 to brutalize and disadvantage the descendants of chattel slavery, including sharecropping,
30 convict leasing, Jim Crow laws, redlining, unequal education, and disproportionate
31 treatment at the hands of the criminal justice system; and
32 (6) As a result of historical and continued discrimination, the descendants of chattel
33 slavery continue to suffer debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships,
34 including having a high level of incarceration, a disproportionate unemployment rate, and
35 an average of less than one-sixteenth of the wealth, a disparity which has worsened, not
36 improved, over time.
37 SECTION 3.
38 Chapter 12 of Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to commissions
39 and other agencies, is amended by adding a new article to read as follows:
