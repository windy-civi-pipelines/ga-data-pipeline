157 corrected net income, the commissioner shall make assessment for taxes due based on the

171 determination date is the first day on which no related changes or corrections for a
172 particular audit remain to be finally determined for the entire group; or
173 (C) If the federal adjustment results from filing an amended federal return, a federal
174 refund claim, or an administrative adjustment request, or if it is a federal adjustment
175 reported on an amended federal return or other similar report filed pursuant to Section
176 6225(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the final determination date is the day on which
177 the amended return, refund claim, administrative adjustment request, or other similar
178 report was filed.
179 (2) In the event the taxpayer fails to notify the commissioner of the final determination
180 of his or her United States income taxes, the commissioner shall proceed to determine,
181 upon evidence that the commissioner has brought to his or her attention or that he or she
182 otherwise acquires, the corrected income of the taxpayer for the fiscal or calendar year.
183 If additional tax is determined to be due, the tax shall be assessed and collected. If it is
184 determined that there has been an overpayment of tax for the year, the taxpayer, by his
185 or her failure to notify the commissioner as required in paragraph (1) of this subsection,
186 shall forfeit his or her right to any refund due by reason of the change or correction. A
187 taxpayer who so fails to notify the commissioner, however, shall be entitled to equitable
188 recoupment of 90 percent of any overpayment so determined against any additional tax
189 liability so determined, the remaining 10 percent of the overpayment being totally
190 forfeited as a penalty for failure to make a return as required by paragraph (1) of this

98 aggrieved taxpayer, the taxpayer shall file with the clerk of the superior court a written
99 statement whereby the taxpayer agrees to pay on the date or dates the taxes become due all
100 taxes for which the taxpayer has admitted liability. Additionally, the taxpayer shall file

103 owned in this state is in excess of the amount of the tax in dispute, a surety bond or other
104 security in an amount satisfactory to the clerk, conditioned to pay any tax over and above
105 that for which the taxpayer has admitted liability and which is found to be due by a final
106 judgment of the court, together with interest and costs. It shall be ground for dismissal of
107 the appeal if the taxpayer fails to pay all taxes admittedly owed upon the due date or dates

144 periods of limitation for assessment of taxes, collection by execution, and change or
145 correction of net income, as follows:
146 "(e)(1) Except as provided in Code Section 48-7-53, when a taxpayer's amount of net
147 income for any year under this chapter as returned to the United States Department of the
148 Treasury is changed or corrected by the commissioner of internal revenue or other officer
149 of the United States of competent authority, the taxpayer, within 180 days after the final
150 determination date of the changed or corrected net income, shall make a return to the
151 commissioner of the changed or corrected income, and the commissioner shall make
152 assessment within one year from the date the return required by this paragraph is filed or
153 the taxpayer shall claim a refund based on the change or correction within one year from
154 the date the return required by this paragraph is filed. If the taxpayer does not make the
155 return reflecting the changed or corrected net income and the commissioner receives from

157 corrected net income, the commissioner shall make assessment for taxes due based on the
158 change or correction within five years from the date the report from the United States
159 government or its agent is actually received. If he or she chooses, the commissioner shall

161 required to comply with this subsection. For purposes of this subsection the final
162 determination date shall be determined as follows:

168 internal revenue and the taxpayer, the final determination date is the date on which the
169 last party signed the agreement; or
170 (B) If the taxpayer filed as a member of a combined or consolidated group, the final
171 determination date is the first day on which no related changes or corrections for a
172 particular audit remain to be finally determined for the entire group; or
173 (C) If the federal adjustment results from filing an amended federal return, a federal
174 refund claim, or an administrative adjustment request, or if it is a federal adjustment
175 reported on an amended federal return or other similar report filed pursuant to Section
176 6225(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the final determination date is the day on which
177 the amended return, refund claim, administrative adjustment request, or other similar
178 report was filed.
179 (2) In the event the taxpayer fails to notify the commissioner of the final determination
180 of his or her United States income taxes, the commissioner shall proceed to determine,
181 upon evidence that the commissioner has brought to his or her attention or that he or she
182 otherwise acquires, the corrected income of the taxpayer for the fiscal or calendar year.
183 If additional tax is determined to be due, the tax shall be assessed and collected. If it is
184 determined that there has been an overpayment of tax for the year, the taxpayer, by his
185 or her failure to notify the commissioner as required in paragraph (1) of this subsection,
186 shall forfeit his or her right to any refund due by reason of the change or correction. A
187 taxpayer who so fails to notify the commissioner, however, shall be entitled to equitable
188 recoupment of 90 percent of any overpayment so determined against any additional tax
189 liability so determined, the remaining 10 percent of the overpayment being totally
190 forfeited as a penalty for failure to make a return as required by paragraph (1) of this
191 subsection."
