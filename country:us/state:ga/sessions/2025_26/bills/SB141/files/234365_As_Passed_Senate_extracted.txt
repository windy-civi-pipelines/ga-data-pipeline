143 correction of net income, as follows:
144 "(e)(1) Except as provided in Code Section 48-7-53, when a taxpayer's amount of net
145 income for any year under this chapter as returned to the United States Department of the
146 Treasury is changed or corrected by the commissioner of internal revenue or other officer
147 of the United States of competent authority, the taxpayer, within 180 days after the final
148 determination date of the changed or corrected net income, shall make a return to the
149 commissioner of the changed or corrected income, and the commissioner shall make
150 assessment within one year from the date the return required by this paragraph is filed or
151 the taxpayer shall claim a refund based on the change or correction within one year from
152 the date the return required by this paragraph is filed. If the taxpayer does not make the
153 return reflecting the changed or corrected net income and the commissioner receives from
154 the United States government or one of its agents a report reflecting the changed or
155 corrected net income, the commissioner shall make assessment for taxes due based on the
156 change or correction within five years from the date the report from the United States
157 government or its agent is actually received. If he or she chooses, the commissioner shall
158 have the authority to establish a de minimis amount upon which a taxpayer shall not be
159 required to comply with this subsection. For purposes of this subsection the final
160 determination date shall be determined as follows:

165 waived or exhausted. For agreements required to be signed by the commissioner of
166 internal revenue and the taxpayer, the final determination date is the date on which the
167 last party signed the agreement; or

168 (B) If the taxpayer filed as a member of a combined or consolidated group, the final
169 determination date is the first day on which no related changes or corrections for a
170 particular audit remain to be finally determined for the entire group; or
171 (C) If the federal adjustment results from filing an amended federal return, a federal
172 refund claim, or an administrative adjustment request, or if it is a federal adjustment
173 reported on an amended federal return or other similar report filed pursuant to Section
174 6225(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the final determination date is the day on which
175 the amended return, refund claim, administrative adjustment request, or other similar
176 report was filed.
177 (2) In the event the taxpayer fails to notify the commissioner of the final determination
178 of his or her United States income taxes, the commissioner shall proceed to determine,
179 upon evidence that the commissioner has brought to his or her attention or that he or she
180 otherwise acquires, the corrected income of the taxpayer for the fiscal or calendar year.
181 If additional tax is determined to be due, the tax shall be assessed and collected. If it is
182 determined that there has been an overpayment of tax for the year, the taxpayer, by his
183 or her failure to notify the commissioner as required in paragraph (1) of this subsection,
184 shall forfeit his or her right to any refund due by reason of the change or correction. A
185 taxpayer who so fails to notify the commissioner, however, shall be entitled to equitable
186 recoupment of 90 percent of any overpayment so determined against any additional tax
187 liability so determined, the remaining 10 percent of the overpayment being totally
188 forfeited as a penalty for failure to make a return as required by paragraph (1) of this
189 subsection."

196 within 30 45 days of cancellation which satisfies the commissioner that the license should
197 be reinstated;"

144 "(e)(1) Except as provided in Code Section 48-7-53, when a taxpayer's amount of net
145 income for any year under this chapter as returned to the United States Department of the
146 Treasury is changed or corrected by the commissioner of internal revenue or other officer
147 of the United States of competent authority, the taxpayer, within 180 days after the final
148 determination date of the changed or corrected net income, shall make a return to the
149 commissioner of the changed or corrected income, and the commissioner shall make
150 assessment within one year from the date the return required by this paragraph is filed or
151 the taxpayer shall claim a refund based on the change or correction within one year from
152 the date the return required by this paragraph is filed. If the taxpayer does not make the
153 return reflecting the changed or corrected net income and the commissioner receives from
154 the United States government or one of its agents a report reflecting the changed or
155 corrected net income, the commissioner shall make assessment for taxes due based on the
156 change or correction within five years from the date the report from the United States
157 government or its agent is actually received. If he or she chooses, the commissioner shall
158 have the authority to establish a de minimis amount upon which a taxpayer shall not be
159 required to comply with this subsection. For purposes of this subsection the final
160 determination date shall be determined as follows:
161 (A) Except as provided in subparagraph subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph,
162 the final determination date is the first day on which no changes or corrections for a
163 particular audit remain to be finally determined, whether by agreement, or, if appealed
164 or contested, by a final decision with respect to which all rights of appeal have been
165 waived or exhausted. For agreements required to be signed by the commissioner of
166 internal revenue and the taxpayer, the final determination date is the date on which the
167 last party signed the agreement; or

168 (B) If the taxpayer filed as a member of a combined or consolidated group, the final
169 determination date is the first day on which no related changes or corrections for a
170 particular audit remain to be finally determined for the entire group; or
171 (C) If the federal adjustment results from filing an amended federal return, a federal
172 refund claim, or an administrative adjustment request, or if it is a federal adjustment
173 reported on an amended federal return or other similar report filed pursuant to Section
174 6225(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the final determination date is the day on which
175 the amended return, refund claim, administrative adjustment request, or other similar
176 report was filed.
177 (2) In the event the taxpayer fails to notify the commissioner of the final determination
178 of his or her United States income taxes, the commissioner shall proceed to determine,
179 upon evidence that the commissioner has brought to his or her attention or that he or she
180 otherwise acquires, the corrected income of the taxpayer for the fiscal or calendar year.
181 If additional tax is determined to be due, the tax shall be assessed and collected. If it is
182 determined that there has been an overpayment of tax for the year, the taxpayer, by his
183 or her failure to notify the commissioner as required in paragraph (1) of this subsection,
184 shall forfeit his or her right to any refund due by reason of the change or correction. A
185 taxpayer who so fails to notify the commissioner, however, shall be entitled to equitable
186 recoupment of 90 percent of any overpayment so determined against any additional tax
187 liability so determined, the remaining 10 percent of the overpayment being totally
188 forfeited as a penalty for failure to make a return as required by paragraph (1) of this
189 subsection."
