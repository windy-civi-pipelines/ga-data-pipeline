22 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
23 PART I
24 SECTION 1-1.
25 This part shall be known and may be cited as the "Timberlands Recovery, Exemption, and
26 Earnings Stability (TREES) Act."
27 SECTION 1-2.
28 The General Assembly finds that:
29 (1) Hurricane Helene has had a catastrophic impact on the citizens and the economy of
30 many areas in this state, has particularly devastated the timber industry on which the
31 citizens of southwest Georgia are heavily dependent for their livelihood by reducing or
32 eliminating the long-held investments in standing timber and timberlands of businesses and
33 families, and has created both a public fire hazard and a danger of insect infestations due
34 to the massive amounts of downed timber caused by the severity of this natural disaster;
35 (2) As of November, 2024, the estimated losses to standing timber caused by Hurricane
36 Helene as measured by the State Forestry Commission were nearly $1.3 billion;
37 (3) Timberlands as investments are unique as an agriculture product in this state, as timber
38 products often take ten years or longer to realize any return on the investment;
39 (4) Many counties, municipalities, and local school districts rely on the taxes levied at the
40 time of timber's harvest or sale pursuant to Code Section 48-5-7.5, but with the destruction
41 of timberlands throughout this state, that tax revenue will likely not be realized; and
H. B. 223

25 HB 223/AP
42 (5) It is the intent of the General Assembly to authorize local governing authorities to
43 provide temporary tax relief from the taxes levied pursuant to Code 48-5-7.5 so that the
44 timber industry, and the businesses and families that provide timber products to such
45 industry, will realize a reduced cost for growing new product and recovering from the
46 devastating effects of Hurricane Helene. These reduced costs will help stabilize the market
47 and allow for quicker harvesting and recovery of lands where some timber is still
48 salvageable.
49 SECTION 1-3.
50 Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to revenue and taxation, is

164 timber property is severely damaged or destroyed. In establishing such criteria, such
165 commission may consider:
166 (A) The average damage sustained throughout the timber property;
167 (B) Whether the timber property has adequate remaining trees per acre to maintain
168 viable timber property; and
