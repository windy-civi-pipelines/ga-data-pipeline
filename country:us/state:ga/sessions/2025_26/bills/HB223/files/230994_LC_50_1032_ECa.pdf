13 SECTION 1.
14 Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to revenue and taxation, is
15 amended in Chapter 7, relating to income taxes, by adding a new paragraph to subsection (a)
16 of Code Section 48-7-27, relating to computation of taxable net income, to read as follows:
H. B. 223

25 LC 50 1032-EC
17 "(11.3) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and ending on or before
18 December 31, 2029, income received as payments from a federal disaster relief or
19 assistance grant program administered by this state or its instrumentalities or the United
20 States Department of Agriculture, if such federal grant program was established
21 specifically to address agricultural losses suffered due to Hurricane Helene which was a
22 weather event declared to be a major disaster in this state by the President of the United
23 States during the 2024 calendar year, to the extent such income is included in federal
24 adjusted gross income or federal taxable income;"
25 SECTION 2.
26 Said title is further amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
27 "48-7-40.37.
28 (a)(1) The General Assembly finds and determines that Hurricane Helene has had a
29 catastrophic impact on the citizens and the economy of Georgia, has particularly
30 devastated the timber industry on which the citizens of Georgia are heavily dependent for
31 their livelihood, and has created both a public fire hazard and a danger of insect
32 infestations due to the massive amounts of downed timber caused by the severity of this
33 natural disaster.
34 (2) The General Assembly further finds and declares that it is appropriate and advisable
35 to provide relief to the timber industry in the form of a tax credit targeted to those
36 taxpayers that have suffered substantial economic losses and that will have to incur
37 significant expenses for salvaging downed timber, site clearance, restoration, and
38 reforestation over the coming years.
39 (b) As used in this Code section, the term:
40 (1) 'Disaster area' means the real property encompassed by the borders of the 66 counties
41 included in the renewal of the State of Emergency pronounced in the Executive Order of

53 damage to or destruction of eligible timber property caused by Hurricane Helene.
54 (c)(1) A taxpayer shall be allowed tax credits against the tax imposed by this article in
55 an amount equal to 100 percent of such taxpayer's timber casualty loss; provided,
56 however, that the credit amount shall not exceed the number of the taxpayer's affected

58 (2) To be allowed such tax credits, a taxpayer shall submit an application for preapproval
59 of such credits based on timber casualty losses incurred by such taxpayer. A taxpayer

70 application is complete or incomplete.
71 (4) In no event shall the commissioner preapprove tax credits pursuant to this Code
72 section in an amount that exceeds $200 million in aggregate.
73 (5) In the event that properly completed and timely submitted preapproval applications
74 are submitted for an amount that exceeds the amount of funds available to fully fund the
75 tax credits requested, the commissioner shall prorate the available funds between or
76 among the applicants.
77 (6) The commissioner shall approve properly completed and timely submitted
78 preapproval applications and issue a preapproval certificate to the taxpayer by
79 January 31, 2026, certifying the amount of credits such taxpayer is eligible to claim if the
80 taxpayer meets the conditions of this Code section.
81 (e) In no event shall the amount of the tax credits allowed pursuant to this Code section
82 exceed $200 million in aggregate.
83 (f)(1)(A) Tax credits allowed pursuant to this Code section shall be eligible to be
84 claimed only by the taxpayer to which the commissioner issued a preapproval
85 certificate.
86 (B) Tax credits allowed pursuant to this Code section shall only be claimed in the
87 taxable year in which the taxpayer first completes:
88 (i) The restoration of each acre for which timber casualty losses were incurred to a
89 condition that has an adequately stocked stand that is expected to result in forest
90 products or ecological services in the foreseeable future; or
91 (ii) The replanting of timber in a quantity projected to yield at maturity at least 90
92 percent of the value of the timber casualty loss claimed. Such timber shall be planted
93 within the same county in which the eligible timber property was being grown when
94 the timber casualty loss was incurred. Timber market conditions as of
95 September 25, 2024, shall be used for the purposes of establishing projected value.

25 LC 50 1032-EC
96 (2) To claim tax credits allowed pursuant to this Code section, a taxpayer shall attach to
97 such taxpayer's state tax return certification from the taxpayer that the requirements of

99 including information which demonstrates that it has completed the restoration or
100 replanting of timber required pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.

105 excess of a taxpayer's income tax liability shall be refundable to such taxpayer, provided
106 that such taxpayer is the same taxpayer that incurred the timber casualty loss.

124 (F) The amount of credits transferred; and
125 (G) Other information as may be required by the department;

132 (5) A transferee shall have only such rights to claim and use the tax credits that were
133 available to the transferor at the time of the transfer; provided, however, that a transferee
134 shall not be eligible to transfer or receive a refund of such tax credits. To the extent that
135 the transferor did not have rights to claim or use the tax credits at the time of the transfer,
136 the commissioner shall disallow the tax credits claimed by the transferee or recapture the
137 tax credits from the transferee or transferor. The transferee's recourse shall not be against

140 a minimum of 60 percent of the amount of the tax credits so transferred.

145 of such taxpayer that may include the review of the tax credits provided in this Code
146 section.
147 (2) The commissioner shall have access to timber property for the purpose of
148 determining eligibility for both the preapproval and claiming of tax credits allowed and

150 taxpayer that submitted a preapproval application or transferred or claimed tax credits
151 pursuant to this Code section and the owner of the underlying real property.
