18 December 31, 2029, income received as payments from a federal disaster relief or
19 assistance grant program administered by this state or its instrumentalities or the United
20 States Department of Agriculture, if such federal grant program was established
21 specifically to address agricultural losses suffered due to Hurricane Helene which was a

23 States during the 2024 calendar year, to the extent such income is included in federal

33 "48-7-40.37.
34 (a)(1) The General Assembly finds and determines that Hurricane Helene has had a
35 catastrophic impact on the citizens and the economy of Georgia, has particularly
36 devastated the timber industry on which the citizens of Georgia are heavily dependent for
37 their livelihood, and has created both a public fire hazard and a danger of insect
38 infestations due to the massive amounts of downed timber caused by the severity of this
39 natural disaster.
40 (2) The General Assembly further finds and declares that it is appropriate and advisable
41 to provide relief to the timber industry in the form of a tax credit targeted to those
42 taxpayers that have suffered substantial economic losses and that will have to incur
