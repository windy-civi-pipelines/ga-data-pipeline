35 section unless such person or person's agent files an application with the tax commissioner
36 of Dade County, giving such information relative to receiving such exemption as will enable
37 the tax commissioner of Dade County to make a determination regarding the initial and
38 continuing eligibility of such person for such exemption. The tax commissioner of Dade
39 County shall provide application forms for this purpose.
40 (d) The exemption shall be claimed and returned as provided in Code Section 48-5-50.1 of
41 the O.C.G.A., as amended. The exemption shall be automatically renewed from year to year
42 so long as the person granted the homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this section

49 who has been granted the exemption provided for in subsection (b) of this section shall
