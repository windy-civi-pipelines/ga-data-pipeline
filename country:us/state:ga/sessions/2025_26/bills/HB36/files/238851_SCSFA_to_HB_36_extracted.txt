455 that, due to such developmental disability or disabilities and other factors that may be
456 present, the proposed ward lacks sufficient capacity to make or communicate significant
457 responsible decisions concerning the management of his or her property.
458 (5)(7) Upon determination of the need for a conservatorship, the court shall determine
459 the powers, if any, which are to be retained by the proposed ward, in accordance with the

- 5 -

25 HB 36/SCSFA

132 argument regardless of whether the proposed ward's legal counsel raised such matters in

141 as defined in paragraph (8) of Code Section 37-1-1, the court shall not find that there is

143 that, due to such developmental disability or disabilities and other factors that may be
144 present, the proposed ward lacks sufficient capacity to make or communicate significant
145 responsible decisions concerning his or her health or safety.
146 (5)(7) Upon determination of the need for a guardianship, the court shall determine the
147 powers, if any, which are to be retained by the proposed ward, in accordance with the
- 6 -

25 HB 36/SCSFA
148 provisions of Code Section 29-4-21 and whether any additional powers are to be granted
149 to the guardian, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of Code Section 29-4-23.
150 (6)(8) If the court determines that a guardianship is necessary and the proposed ward is
151 present, the proposed ward may suggest any individual as guardian. The court shall
152 select as guardian the individual who will serve the best interest of the ward.
153 (7)(9) In any procedure under this chapter in which the judge of the court is unable to
154 hear a case within the time required for such hearing, the judge shall appoint an
155 individual to hear the case and exercise all the jurisdiction of the court in the case. Any
156 individual appointed shall be a member of the State Bar of Georgia who is qualified to
157 serve as the probate judge in that county and who is, in the opinion of the appointing
158 judge, qualified for the duties by training and experience. The appointment may be made
159 on a case-by-case basis or by making a standing appointment of one or more individuals.
160 Any individual who receives a standing appointment shall serve at the pleasure of the
161 judge who makes the appointment or the judge's successor in office. The compensation
162 of an individual appointed shall be as agreed upon by the judge who makes the
163 appointment and the individual appointed, with the approval of the governing authority
164 of the county for which the individual is appointed, and shall be paid from county funds.
165 All fees collected for the service of the appointed individual shall be paid into the general
166 funds of the county."
167 SECTION 6.

180 worker is not available, a physician, psychologist, or physician assistant, nurse
181 practitioner, clinical nurse specialist in psychiatric/mental health, professional counselor,

193 (2) Order an emergency hearing to be conducted not sooner than three days nor later than
194 five days after the filing of the petition;
195 (3) Order an evaluation of the proposed ward by a physician an evaluator who shall be
196 a physician licensed to practice medicine under Chapter 34 of Title 43, a psychologist
197 licensed to practice under Chapter 39 of Title 43, a physician assistant licensed under
198 Chapter 34 of Title 43, a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist in
199 psychiatric/mental health licensed or registered under Chapter 26 of Title 43, a
- 8 -

25 HB 36/SCSFA
200 professional counselor licensed under Chapter 10A of Title 43, or a licensed clinical
201 social worker, other than the physician, psychologist, or physician assistant, nurse
202 practitioner, clinical nurse specialist in psychiatric/mental health, professional counselor,
203 or licensed clinical social worker who completed the affidavit attached to the petition
204 pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Code Section 29-4-10. The evaluation
205 shall be conducted within 72 hours of the time the order was issued and a written report

209 (4) Immediately notify the proposed ward of the proceedings by service of all pleadings

216 ward may lose important rights to control the management of the proposed ward's
217 person;
218 (C) Inform the proposed ward of the place and time at which the proposed ward shall
219 submit to the evaluation provided for by paragraph (3) of this subsection;
220 (D) Inform the proposed ward of the appointment of legal counsel; and
221 (E) Inform the proposed ward of the date and time of the hearing on the emergency

229 nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist in psychiatric/mental health licensed or
230 registered under Chapter 26 of Title 43, a professional counselor licensed under Chapter

242 forth in its order, to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence of the need
243 for an emergency guardianship in light of the evidence taken at the hearing. In addition to
244 the evidence at the hearing, the court may consider the evaluation report and any response
245 filed by the proposed ward. The proposed ward may also challenge, by appropriate
246 evidence and argument, the sufficiency and weight of the results and conclusions of the
247 evaluation and written report and the qualifications, experience, or abilities of the person
248 performing the evaluation. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner. Upon the
249 consent of the petitioner and the proposed ward, the court may grant a continuance of the
250 case for a period not to exceed 30 days.
251 (b) If the court at the emergency hearing finds that an emergency guardianship is
252 necessary, the court shall order the emergency guardianship; provided, however, that:
- 10 -

25 HB 36/SCSFA
253 (1) Any emergency guardian shall have only those powers and duties specifically
254 enumerated in the letters of emergency guardianship and the powers and duties shall not
255 exceed those absolutely necessary to respond to the immediate threatened risk to the
256 ward;
257 (2) The court may order the emergency guardian to make any report the court requires;
258 (3) If the court finds that the proposed ward has one or more developmental disabilities
259 as defined in paragraph (8) of Code Section 37-1-1, the court shall not find that there is
260 a need for an emergency guardianship unless the evidence shows by clear and convincing
261 evidence that, due to such developmental disability or disabilities and other factors that
262 may be present, the proposed ward lacks sufficient capacity to make or communicate
263 significant responsible decisions concerning his or her health or safety and there is an
264 immediate and substantial risk of death or serious physical injury, illness, or disease
265 unless an emergency guardian is appointed; and
266 (3)(4) The emergency guardianship shall terminate on the earliest of:
267 (A) The court's removal of the emergency guardian, with or without cause;
268 (B) The effective date of the appointment of a guardian;
269 (C) Unless otherwise specified in the order of dismissal, the dismissal of a petition for
270 appointment of a guardian;
271 (D) The date specified for the termination in the order appointing the emergency
272 guardian;
273 (E) Sixty days from the date of appointment of the emergency guardian, provided that
274 the court had jurisdiction to issue such order under paragraph (1) of Code
275 Section 29-11-12; or
276 (F) Ninety days from the date of appointment of the emergency guardian, provided that
277 the court had jurisdiction to issue such order under paragraph (2) or (3) of Code
278 Section 29-11-12."
- 11 -

25 HB 36/SCSFA
279 SECTION 9.
280 Said title is further amended in Code Section 29-4-41, relating to modification of
