1070 Said title is further amended by revising Code Section 53-2-27, relating to DNA testing for
1071 kinship, procedure, and costs, as follows:
1072 "53-2-27.
1073 (a)(1) When the kinship of any party in interest to a decedent is in controversy in any
1074 proceeding under this article, a probate court or superior court may order the removal and
1075 testing of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from the remains of the decedent and
1076 from any party in interest whose kinship to the decedent is in controversy for purposes
1077 of comparison and determination of the statistical likelihood of such kinship; provided,
1078 however, that no DNA testing shall be ordered with respect to any party in interest whose
1079 kinship to the decedent was created or terminated by a decree of adoption, pursuant to
1080 subsection (a) of Code Section 19-8-19, unless the right of inheritance of such party in
1081 interest was not affected by the adoption, pursuant to subsection (b) of Code Section
1082 19-8-19, or if such party in interest was conceived by means of artificial insemination,
1083 in vitro fertilization, or other similar method of assisted reproduction; and provided,
1084 further, that, for purposes of this subsection, a decree of adoption shall include:
1085 (A) Any such decree entered pursuant to Article 1 of Chapter 8 of Title 19;
1086 (B) Any such decree recognized in this state pursuant to Code Section 19-8-22; or
1087 (C) A final order entered pursuant to Code Section 19-8-43.
1088 (2) The court may order the disinterment of the decedent's remains if reasonably
1089 necessary to obtain such DNA samples for testing under this subsection.
1090 (b) The An order pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section may be made entered only
1091 on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to all parties in interest, and such order
1092 shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the removal and testing of
1093 samples, and the person or persons by whom it is such removal and testing of DNA
1094 samples are to be made. When such motion is made prior to the birth of a child whose
1095 kinship to the decedent is in controversy, such order shall direct that the DNA testing be
H. B. 327 (SUB)
- 43 -
25 LC 48 1516S
1096 conducted as soon as medically feasible after the birth of such child and may stay the
1097 proceedings until after the child's birth except service of notice; provided, however, that
1098 the requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Code Section 53-2-1 shall remain
1099 applicable to such child. Such motion, when made by a party in interest, shall be supported
1100 by affidavit setting forth:
1101 (1) The factual basis for a reasonable belief that the party in interest whose kinship to the
1102 decedent is in controversy is or is not so related; and
1103 (2) If disinterment of the decedent's remains is sought, the factual basis for a reasonable
1104 belief that reliable DNA samples from the decedent are not otherwise reasonably
1105 available from any other source.
1106 (c) Upon request of a party in interest to a proceeding under this article or as ordered by
1107 the court on its own motion in the exercise of its discretion, the movant shall, within ten
1108 days after such request is made or such order is entered, but in no event later than ten days
1109 prior to the date of a hearing at which such report may be introduced into evidence, deliver
1110 to all parties in interest a copy of a detailed written report of the tester and of any other
1111 expert or other qualified person involved in the determination of such statistical likelihood
1112 setting out his or her findings, including the results of all tests made and conclusions or
1113 opinions based thereon. Unless a party in interest objects in writing within seven days after
1114 receiving such report and prior to the date of such hearing, such report shall be admitted
1115 in evidence without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or
1116 accuracy. When a timely objection is filed, such report shall be admitted in evidence when
1117 offered by a duly qualified licensed practicing physician, duly qualified immunologist, or
1118 other duly qualified person; provided, however, that in all cases the court shall determine
1119 the number and qualifications of the experts. Other relevant evidence shall be admitted as
1120 is deemed appropriate by the court. To provide any party in interest an adequate
1121 opportunity to be heard or as otherwise appears reasonably necessary to a just
1122 determination in a proceeding under this article, the court shall grant a continuance of any
H. B. 327 (SUB)
- 44 -
25 LC 48 1516S
1123 such hearing. Upon motion of any party in interest or on the court's own motion, any
1124 hearing or trial held in a proceeding under this article may be held in closed court without
1125 any person other than those necessary to the proceeding being admitted.
1126 (d)(1) The costs of obtaining and testing of such DNA samples, including the costs of
1127 disinterment and reinterment of the remains of the decedent, if necessary, as well as the
1128 costs of providing the report, shall be assessed against and paid by the moving party, and
1129 the court may award such costs as part of its final decree; provided, however, that the
1130 court may, in its discretion after all parties in interest have been given reasonable
1131 opportunity to be heard, cast all or part of such costs against one or more parties in
1132 interest upon entering a finding of fact that any such party has asserted in bad faith a
1133 position with respect to the kinship in controversy in a proceeding under this article or
1134 has failed unreasonably to cooperate with an order for DNA testing entered pursuant to
1135 this Code section. The costs of disinterment may include a reasonable fee for services
1136 provided by a cemetery company in connection therewith, subject to the limitation upon
1137 such charges imposed by subsection (d) of Code Section 10-14-17.
1138 (2) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court may, in
1139 its discretion after all parties in interest have been given reasonable opportunity to be
1140 heard, order reasonable fees of counsel, experts, and guardians ad litem and other costs
1141 of the proceeding, including pretrial proceedings, to be paid by the parties in interest in
1142 proportions and at times determined by the court.
1143 (3) The trier of fact shall receive without foundation or the need for third-party testimony
1144 evidence of the costs and fees provided for by this subsection, and the evidence so
1145 presented shall constitute prima-facie evidence of the amounts of the costs so incurred.
1146 Copies of bills for the obtaining and testing of DNA samples, including the costs of
1147 disinterment and reinterment of the remains of the decedent, if necessary, furnished to all
1148 parties in interest at least ten days prior to the date of a hearing at which such copies of
1149 bills may be introduced into evidence, are admissible in evidence to prove that the
H. B. 327 (SUB)
- 45 -
25 LC 48 1516S
1150 charges billed were reasonable, necessary, and customary; provided, however, that
1151 nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the right of a thorough and sifting
1152 cross-examination as to such evidence.
1153 (e) DNA testing performed pursuant to this Code section shall be conducted by a
1154 laboratory certified by the American Association of Blood Banks, shall be conducted so
1155 that the results meet the standards the American Association of Blood Banks requires in
1156 order for such results to be admitted as evidence in a court of law, and shall be performed
1157 by a duly qualified licensed practicing physician, duly qualified immunologist, or other
1158 duly qualified person; provided, however, that in all cases the court before which
1159 proceedings on the estate are pending shall determine the number and qualifications of the
1160 experts.
1161 (f) An order for DNA testing entered pursuant to this Code section shall be enforceable by
1162 contempt; provided, however, that, if the movant refuses to submit to such an order, the
1163 court may, in its discretion after all parties in interest have been given reasonable
1164 opportunity to be heard, dismiss or strike the movant's pleadings upon motion by any party
1165 in interest or on the court's own motion.
1166 (g) Except as ordered by the court for good cause shown pursuant to subsection (b) of this
1167 Code section, the genetic material collected for DNA testing performed pursuant to this
1168 Code section:
1169 (1) If collected through the disinterment of the decedent's remains, shall be destroyed
1170 within a reasonable time as determined by the court;
1171 (2) If made available from a source other than through the disinterment of the decedent's
1172 remains, shall be destroyed or returned in the manner reasonably directed by such source
1173 or in accordance with such source's standard rules and regulations; and
1174 (3) Shall not be shared with any other person or entity except to the extent reasonably
1175 necessary for compliance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection.

1176 (h) The disinterment and reinterment of the decedent's remains in accordance with a court
1177 order entered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section:
1178 (1) Shall not require a permit under Code Section 12-3-52, 12-3-82, or 36-72-4 as a
1179 condition precedent to such disinterment;
1180 (2) Shall not require authorization under subsection (f) of Code Section 31-10-20 as a
1181 condition precedent to such disinterment or reinterment;
1182 (3) Shall not constitute a disturbance, destruction, defacing, mutilation, removal, or
1183 exposure of interred human remains under Code Section 31-21-6;
1184 (4) Shall not constitute a violation of any provision of Code Section 31-21-44;
1185 (5) Shall be supervised, monitored, or carried out as provided in Code Section 36-72-15
1186 when such disinterment or reinterment is in an abandoned cemetery or burial ground, as
1187 defined in Code Section 36-72-2; provided, however, that nothing in Code Section
1188 36-72-15 shall affect the assessment, allocation, or payment of costs ordered by the court
1189 pursuant to subsection (d) of this Code section; and
1190 (6) May be done by any person who is or is able to be authorized to disinter the remains
1191 of a human body under Code Section 45-16-45 or subsection (b) of Code Section
1192 45-16-51; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall limit the persons whom
1193 the court may designate to perform such disinterment pursuant to subsection (b) of this
1194 Code section.
1195 (i) Any person disinterring or reinterring a decedent's remains in accordance with a court
1196 order entered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section shall be deemed to be a person
1197 having duties imposed upon that person relating to the possession or disposition of dead
1198 bodies while in the performance of said duties within the meaning of subsection (b) of
1199 Code Section 31-21-44.
1200 (j) DNA testing performed pursuant to this Code section shall be deemed to be genetic
1201 testing conducted to obtain information for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes within the
1202 meaning of subsection (a) of Code Section 33-54-3; provided, however, that DNA testing

1930 not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the original trust
1931 instrument, would have prevented such original trust from qualifying under such section;
1932 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section, when the original trust
1933 does not qualify as a grantor trust and the donor is alive, the terms of the second trust
1934 shall not provide for a power of disposition that is not exempt from the application of

1941 date the trustee proposes to distribute from the original trust to the second trust, such
1942 second trust may qualify as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes, even if such
1943 original trust does not so qualify, except that if such original trust does not so qualify and
1944 such second trust will so qualify, in whole or in part, with respect to the settlor donor,
1945 such second trust shall grant such settlor donor or another person a power that would
1946 cause such second trust to cease to be a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes; and
1947 (3)(4) When both the original trust and the second trust qualify as grantor trusts for
1948 federal income tax purposes and such original trust grants the settlor donor or another
1949 person the power to cause such original trust to cease to be a grantor trust, such second
1950 trust shall grant an equivalent power to the settlor donor or another person unless such

1964 property of the original trust to the second trust under subsection (b) of this Code section
1965 or any other law or common law shall not be liable for any action or failure to act as a
1966 result of such reliance.
1967 (m) This Code section shall not create or imply a duty for a trustee or trust director to
1968 exercise a power conferred by this Code section.
1969 (n) If exercise of the power to invade the distribute income or principal of the original trust
1970 would be effective under subsection (b) of this Code section except that the second trust
1971 in part does not comply with this Code section, such exercise of the power shall be
1972 effective, a provision in such second trust that is not permitted under this Code section shall
1973 be void to the extent necessary to comply with this Code section, and a provision required
1974 by this Code section to be in such second trust that is not contained in such second trust

2565 person on the next date on which the person accesses the electronic portal.

2570 suitable under the circumstances:

2634 limited to, showing the efficacy of a security procedure applied to determine the person
2635 to which the electronic record or electronic signature was attributable.
2636 (2) The effect of attribution to a person under paragraph (1) of this subsection of a record

2648 (1) The requirement shall be satisfied by retaining, transmitting, copying, or filing an
2649 electronic record that:

2498 under this chapter, under the provisions of a trust instrument, or with respect to any matter

2516 notices and records will be made available in the electronic portal;
2517 (ii) The notice or record is made available in the electronic portal;
2518 (iii) Concurrently with or subsequently to the notice or record being made available

2524 available in the electronic portal.
2525 (B) If the person objects to notices or the sending of records by means of an electronic

2529 existence of a claim would not have been adequately disclosed to the beneficiary for
2530 purposes of Code Section 53-12-307 but for the sending of the record, the running of the
2531 limitations period under Code Section 53-12-307 for such claim shall be tolled if the
2532 beneficiary's access to the electronic portal is terminated without his or her consent or the
2533 record is no longer available in the electronic portal; provided, however, that the period
2534 shall not be tolled if, within 30 days after such event, the beneficiary is notified of an
2535 alternative means by which to obtain the record. If the limitations period is tolled, the
H. B. 327 (SUB)
- 99 -

25 LC 48 1516S
2536 period shall recommence on the date on which the record is resent to the beneficiary,
2537 whether by means of an electronic portal or otherwise.

2541 (i) Any person with respect to any matter involving a particular trust, by providing
2542 the electronic address to any other person to be used to receive notices and records

2544 person is the person providing notice or sending the record; and
2545 (ii) A particular person with respect to any matter involving any trust, by providing

2549 (B) The use of an electronic address by a person with respect to any matter involving
2550 a trust shall constitute a provision of the electronic address with respect to the trust
2551 under division (i) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the use of an electronic
2552 address to communicate with another person with respect to any matter involving a trust
2553 shall constitute a provision of the electronic address to the other person under division
2554 (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.
2555 (2) Requiring a person to take steps to activate his or her account in an electronic portal
2556 or take other similar actions to establish access to an electronic portal shall not prevent
2557 the person from having been granted access to the electronic portal.
2558 (3) A notice or record shall not be considered to have been made available in an
2559 electronic portal unless a person who has been granted access to the electronic portal can
2560 download or otherwise preserve a copy of the notice or record outside of the electronic
2561 portal.

2563 by division (c)(4)(A)(iii) of this Code section is not provided to a person who has been
2564 granted access to the electronic portal, such notice shall be deemed provided to such
2565 person on the next date on which the person accesses the electronic portal.
2566 (5) A person's access to an electronic portal shall not be considered to have been
2567 terminated without his or her consent solely because such person is required to change
2568 or reset his or her password or take other similar actions to preserve his or her access.
2569 (f) With respect to whether notice or the sending of a record to a person was reasonably
2570 suitable under the circumstances:
2571 (1) For purposes of Code Section 53-12-307 providing for the limitation of actions, the
2572 sending of a record to a person in a manner that is likely to result in receipt shall be
2573 presumed to have been accomplished in a manner that was reasonably suitable under the
2574 circumstances unless proven otherwise by clear and convincing evidence; and
2575 (2) For all other purposes, whether notice or the sending of a record to a person was
2576 accomplished in a manner reasonably suitable under the circumstances shall be
2577 determined, without limitation, in the context of the subject matter of the notice or record,
2578 the length of any time period imposed with respect to notice or sending of the record, the
2579 circumstances of the person, the sender's knowledge of those circumstances, and when
2580 actual receipt, if any, occurred.
2581 (g) Notice to a person or the sending of a record to a person shall be deemed:
2582 (1) To have been accomplished on the date such person has actual knowledge of the
2583 contents of the notice or record; and
2584 (2) Not to have been accomplished if the person providing notice or sending a record has
2585 actual knowledge the person did not receive the notice or record.
2586 (h) Notice or the sending of a record to a person otherwise required under this chapter or
2587 the trust instrument:

2589 reasonably ascertainable by the trustee, trust director, or other person required to provide
2590 the notice or send the record; and

2592 (i) An action by a trustee, trust director, or other person authorized under this chapter or
2593 a trust instrument to act with respect to any matter involving a trust shall not be ineffective

2596 (j) Notice of a judicial proceeding shall be provided as required by the applicable rules of
2597 civil procedure.
2598 (k) This Code section shall be construed and applied to be consistent with reasonable

2605 including, but not limited to:
2606 (1) Exercises, delegations, determinations, releases, waivers, renunciations, disclaimers,

2629 electronic record satisfies the requirement.
2630 (3) If other laws of this state or a trust instrument require a signature to be in writing, an
2631 electronic signature satisfies the requirement.
2632 (e)(1) An electronic record or electronic signature is attributable to a person if it was the
2633 act of the person. The act of the person may be shown in any manner, including, but not
2634 limited to, showing the efficacy of a security procedure applied to determine the person
2635 to which the electronic record or electronic signature was attributable.
2636 (2) The effect of attribution to a person under paragraph (1) of this subsection of a record
2637 or signature shall be determined from the context and surrounding circumstances at the
2638 time of its creation, execution, or adoption and as provided by other law.

2648 (1) The requirement shall be satisfied by retaining, transmitting, copying, or filing an
2649 electronic record that:
