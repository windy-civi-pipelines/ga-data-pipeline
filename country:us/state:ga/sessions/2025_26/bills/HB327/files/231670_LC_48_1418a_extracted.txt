1066 however, that no DNA testing shall be ordered with respect to any party in interest whose
1067 kinship to the decedent was created or terminated by a decree of adoption, pursuant to
1068 subsection (a) of Code Section 19-8-19, unless the right of inheritance of such party in
1069 interest was not affected by the adoption, pursuant to subsection (b) of Code Section
1070 19-8-19, or if such party in interest was conceived by means of artificial insemination,
1071 in vitro fertilization, or other similar method of assisted reproduction; and provided,
1072 further, that, for purposes of this subsection, a decree of adoption shall include:
1073 (A) Any such decree entered pursuant to Article 1 of Chapter 8 of Title 19;
1074 (B) Any such decree recognized in this state pursuant to Code Section 19-8-22; or
1075 (C) A final order entered pursuant to Code Section 19-8-43.
1076 (2) The court may order the disinterment of the decedent's remains if reasonably
1077 necessary to obtain such DNA samples for testing under this subsection.
1078 (b) The An order pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section may be made entered only
1079 on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to all parties in interest, and such order
1080 shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the removal and testing of
1081 samples, and the person or persons by whom it is such removal and testing of DNA
1082 samples are to be made. When such motion is made prior to the birth of a child whose
1083 kinship to the decedent is in controversy, such order shall direct that the DNA testing be
1084 conducted as soon as medically feasible after the birth of such child and may stay the
1085 proceedings until after the child's birth except service of notice; provided, however, that
1086 the requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Code Section 53-2-1 shall remain
1087 applicable to such child. Such motion, when made by a party in interest, shall be supported
1088 by affidavit setting forth:
1089 (1) The factual basis for a reasonable belief that the party in interest whose kinship to the
1090 decedent is in controversy is or is not so related; and
H. B. 327
- 43 -
25 LC 48 1418
1091 (2) If disinterment of the decedent's remains is sought, the factual basis for a reasonable
1092 belief that reliable DNA samples from the decedent are not otherwise reasonably
1093 available from any other source.
1094 (c) Upon request of a party in interest to a proceeding under this article or as ordered by
1095 the court on its own motion in the exercise of its discretion, the movant shall, within ten
1096 days after such request is made or such order is entered, but in no event later than ten days
1097 prior to the date of a hearing at which such report may be introduced into evidence, deliver
1098 to all parties in interest a copy of a detailed written report of the tester and of any other
1099 expert or other qualified person involved in the determination of such statistical likelihood
1100 setting out his or her findings, including the results of all tests made and conclusions or
1101 opinions based thereon. Unless a party in interest objects in writing within seven days after
1102 receiving such report and prior to the date of such hearing, such report shall be admitted
1103 in evidence without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or
1104 accuracy. When a timely objection is filed, such report shall be admitted in evidence when
1105 offered by a duly qualified licensed practicing physician, duly qualified immunologist, or
1106 other duly qualified person; provided, however, that in all cases the court shall determine
1107 the number and qualifications of the experts. Other relevant evidence shall be admitted as
1108 is deemed appropriate by the court. To provide any party in interest an adequate
1109 opportunity to be heard or as otherwise appears reasonably necessary to a just
1110 determination in a proceeding under this article, the court shall grant a continuance of any
1111 such hearing. Upon motion of any party in interest or on the court's own motion, any
1112 hearing or trial held in a proceeding under this article may be held in closed court without
1113 any person other than those necessary to the proceeding being admitted.
1114 (d)(1) The costs of obtaining and testing of such DNA samples, including the costs of
1115 disinterment and reinterment of the remains of the decedent, if necessary, as well as the
1116 costs of providing the report, shall be assessed against and paid by the moving party, and
1117 the court may award such costs as part of its final decree; provided, however, that the
H. B. 327
- 44 -
25 LC 48 1418
1118 court may, in its discretion after all parties in interest have been given reasonable
1119 opportunity to be heard, cast all or part of such costs against one or more parties in
1120 interest upon entering a finding of fact that any such party has asserted in bad faith a
1121 position with respect to the kinship in controversy in a proceeding under this article or
1122 has failed unreasonably to cooperate with an order for DNA testing entered pursuant to
1123 this Code section. The costs of disinterment may include a reasonable fee for services
1124 provided by a cemetery company in connection therewith, subject to the limitation upon
1125 such charges imposed by subsection (d) of Code Section 10-14-17.
1126 (2) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court may, in
1127 its discretion after all parties in interest have been given reasonable opportunity to be
1128 heard, order reasonable fees of counsel, experts, and guardians ad litem and other costs
1129 of the proceeding, including pretrial proceedings, to be paid by the parties in interest in
1130 proportions and at times determined by the court.
1131 (3) The trier of fact shall receive without foundation or the need for third-party testimony
1132 evidence of the costs and fees provided for by this subsection, and the evidence so
1133 presented shall constitute prima-facie evidence of the amounts of the costs so incurred.
1134 Copies of bills for the obtaining and testing of DNA samples, including the costs of
1135 disinterment and reinterment of the remains of the decedent, if necessary, furnished to all
1136 parties in interest at least ten days prior to the date of a hearing at which such copies of
1137 bills may be introduced into evidence, are admissible in evidence to prove that the
1138 charges billed were reasonable, necessary, and customary; provided, however, that
1139 nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the right of a thorough and sifting
1140 cross-examination as to such evidence.
1141 (e) DNA testing performed pursuant to this Code section shall be conducted by a
1142 laboratory certified by the American Association of Blood Banks, shall be conducted so
1143 that the results meet the standards the American Association of Blood Banks requires in
1144 order for such results to be admitted as evidence in a court of law, and shall be performed
H. B. 327
- 45 -

1145 by a duly qualified licensed practicing physician, duly qualified immunologist, or other
1146 duly qualified person; provided, however, that in all cases the court before which
1147 proceedings on the estate are pending shall determine the number and qualifications of the
1148 experts.
1149 (f) An order for DNA testing entered pursuant to this Code section shall be enforceable by
1150 contempt; provided, however, that, if the movant refuses to submit to such an order, the
1151 court may, in its discretion after all parties in interest have been given reasonable
1152 opportunity to be heard, dismiss or strike the movant's pleadings upon motion by any party
1153 in interest or on the court's own motion.

1155 Code section, the genetic material collected for DNA testing performed pursuant to this
1156 Code section:
1157 (1) If collected through the disinterment of the decedent's remains, shall be destroyed
1158 within a reasonable time as determined by the court;
1159 (2) If made available from a source other than through the disinterment of the decedent's
1160 remains, shall be destroyed or returned in the manner reasonably directed by such source
1161 or in accordance with such source's standard rules and regulations; and
1162 (3) Shall not be shared with any other person or entity except to the extent reasonably
1163 necessary for compliance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection.
1164 (h) The disinterment and reinterment of the decedent's remains in accordance with a court
1165 order entered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section:
1166 (1) Shall not require a permit under Code Section 12-3-52, 12-3-82, or 36-72-4 as a
1167 condition precedent to such disinterment;
1168 (2) Shall not require authorization under subsection (f) of Code Section 31-10-20 as a
1169 condition precedent to such disinterment or reinterment;
1170 (3) Shall not constitute a disturbance, destruction, defacing, mutilation, removal, or
1171 exposure of interred human remains under Code Section 31-21-6;
H. B. 327

1176 36-72-15 shall affect the assessment, allocation, or payment of costs ordered by the court
1177 pursuant to subsection (d) of this Code section; and
1178 (6) May be done by any person who is or is able to be authorized to disinter the remains
1179 of a human body under Code Section 45-16-45 or subsection (b) of Code Section
1180 45-16-51; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall limit the persons whom
1181 the court may designate to perform such disinterment pursuant to subsection (b) of this
1182 Code section.
1183 (i) Any person disinterring or reinterring a decedent's remains in accordance with a court
1184 order entered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section shall be deemed to be a person
1185 having duties imposed upon that person relating to the possession or disposition of dead
1186 bodies while in the performance of said duties within the meaning of subsection (b) of
1187 Code Section 31-21-44.
1188 (j) DNA testing performed pursuant to this Code section shall be deemed to be genetic
1189 testing conducted to obtain information for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes within the
1190 meaning of subsection (a) of Code Section 33-54-3; provided, however, that DNA testing
1191 performed pursuant to this Code section may be conducted without written consent prior

1814 an irrevocable trust, even if the modification or termination is inconsistent with a material
H. B. 327
- 71 -
25 LC 48 1418
1815 purpose of the trust, if the settlor and all qualified beneficiaries consent to such
1816 modification or termination and the trustee has received been given notice of the proposed
1817 modification or termination. A settlor's power to consent to such trust's modification or

1833 transfer to any other trust qualified for a charitable deduction under Sections 170(a),
1834 2055(a), or 2522(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, the trust may not be modified

1844 Said title is further amended by revising Code Section 53-12-62, relating to power of trustee
1845 to invade principal of original trust, as follows:
1846 "53-12-62.
1847 (a) As used in this Code section, the term:

1855 a person who contributed property donor to the trust, with the discretionary authority to
1856 invade the distribute income or principal of the original trust to make distributions to or
1857 for the benefit of one or more of the beneficiaries may also, independently or with court
1858 approval, exercise such authority by distributing all or part of the income or principal of
1859 the original trust subject to such discretion to a trustee of a second trust; provided,
1860 however, that the second trust shall not include as a:
1861 (A) Current beneficiary any person that is not a current beneficiary of income or
1862 principal of the original trust; or
1863 (B) Beneficiary any person that is not a beneficiary of the original trust.
1864 (c) Except as provided in this Code section, a trustee may exercise the power to invade the
1865 distribute income or principal of the original trust under subsection (b) of this Code section
1866 without the consent of the settlor or the beneficiaries of the original trust if such trustee
H. B. 327
- 73 -
25 LC 48 1418
1867 provides written notice of such trustee's decision to exercise the power to such settlor, if
1868 living, any trust director, and those persons then entitled to annual reports from the trustee
1869 of the original trust under subsection (b) of Code Section 53-12-243, taking into account
1870 the provisions of the original trust and subsections (c) and (d) of Code Section 53-12-243.

1880 the rule against perpetuities that applies to such original trust.
1881 (f) The exercise of the power to invade the distribute income or principal of the original
1882 trust under subsection (b) of this Code section by a trustee who is also a beneficiary shall
1883 be subject to the limitations of Code Section 53-12-270.
1884 (g) This Code section shall not be construed to abridge the right of any trustee who has a
1885 power of invasion to distribute property income or principal in further trust that arises
1886 under any other law or under common law, and nothing in this Code section shall be
1887 construed to imply that the common law does not permit the exercise of a power to invade
1888 the distribute income or principal of a trust in the manner authorized under subsection (b)
1889 of this Code section.
1890 (h) A second trust may confer a power of appointment upon a beneficiary of the original
1891 trust to whom or for the benefit of whom the trustee has the power to distribute the income
1892 or principal of such original trust. For purposes of this subsection, the permissible

25 LC 48 1418
1893 appointees of the power of appointment conferred upon a beneficiary may include persons
1894 who are not beneficiaries of such original trust or second trust.
1895 (i) If any contribution to the original trust qualified for the annual exclusion under Section
1896 2503(b) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, as it existed on February 1, 2018, the marital
1897 deduction under Section 2056(a) or 2523(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, as it
1898 existed on February 1, 2018, or the charitable deduction under Section 170(a), 642(c),

1903 subsection (b) of this Code section for income, gift, estate, or generation-skipping transfer
1904 tax purposes under the federal Internal Revenue Code, then the authorized trustee shall not
1905 have the power to distribute the income or principal of a trust pursuant to subsection (b) of
1906 this Code section in a manner that would prevent the contribution to the original trust from
1907 qualifying for such exclusion, deduction, or other tax benefit or would reduce such
1908 exclusion, deduction, or other tax benefit that was originally claimed with respect to such
1909 contribution.
1910 (j) The exercise of the power to invade the distribute income or principal of the original
1911 trust under subsection (b) of this Code section shall be subject to the following limitations
1912 with respect to any portion of the original trust or second trust that does or will qualify as
1913 a grantor trust with respect to a donor:
1914 (1) The second trust need not qualify as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes,
1915 even if the original trust does qualify as a grantor trust, except that if such original trust
1916 qualifies as a grantor trust because of the application of Section 672(f)(2)(A) of the
1917 federal Internal Revenue Code, as it existed on February 1, 2018, such second trust may
1918 not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the original trust
1919 instrument, would have prevented such original trust from qualifying under such section;
H. B. 327
- 75 -
25 LC 48 1418
1920 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section, when the original trust
1921 does not qualify as a grantor trust and the donor is alive, the terms of the second trust
1922 shall not provide for a power of disposition that is not exempt from the application of
1923 subsection (a) of Section 674 of the federal Internal Revenue Code unless an adverse
1924 party, as defined in subsection (a) of Section 672 of the federal Internal Revenue Code,
1925 approves or consents to the inclusion of the power in the second trust. Subject to
1926 paragraph (3) of this subsection, the second trust may qualify as a grantor trust pursuant
1927 to other sections of the federal Internal Revenue Code;
1928 (2)(3) Unless the settlor the donor objects in a writing delivered to the trustee before the
1929 date the trustee proposes to distribute from the original trust to the second trust, such
1930 second trust may qualify as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes, even if such
1931 original trust does not so qualify, except that if such original trust does not so qualify and
1932 such second trust will so qualify, in whole or in part, with respect to the settlor donor,
1933 such second trust shall grant such settlor donor or another person a power that would
1934 cause such second trust to cease to be a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes; and
1935 (3)(4) When both the original trust and the second trust qualify as grantor trusts for
1936 federal income tax purposes and such original trust grants the settlor donor or another
1937 person the power to cause such original trust to cease to be a grantor trust, such second
1938 trust shall grant an equivalent power to the settlor donor or another person unless such
1939 settlor donor objects in a writing delivered to the trustee before the date the trustee
1940 proposes to distribute from such original trust to such second trust.
1941 For purposes of this subsection, a trust that is a 'grantor trust' or that qualifies as a 'grantor

1953 or any other law or common law shall not be liable for any action or failure to act as a
1954 result of such reliance.
1955 (m) This Code section shall not create or imply a duty for a trustee or trust director to
1956 exercise a power conferred by this Code section.
1957 (n) If exercise of the power to invade the distribute income or principal of the original trust
1958 would be effective under subsection (b) of this Code section except that the second trust
1959 in part does not comply with this Code section, such exercise of the power shall be
1960 effective, a provision in such second trust that is not permitted under this Code section shall
1961 be void to the extent necessary to comply with this Code section, and a provision required
1962 by this Code section to be in such second trust that is not contained in such second trust
1963 shall be deemed to be included in such second trust to the extent necessary to comply with
1964 this Code section.
1965 (o) The settlor donor of the original trust shall be deemed to be the settlor donor of the
1966 second trust with respect to the portion of the income or principal of the original trust
1967 subject to the exercise of the power to invade distribute the principal of such original trust
1968 under subsection (b) of this Code section. The settlor of the second trust shall be the
1969 person who creates the second trust, including a testator in the case of a testamentary trust;
1970 provided, however, that, if the trustee of the original trust creates the second trust, the
1971 settlor of the original trust shall be deemed to be the settlor of the second trust.
1972 (p) A debt, liability, or other obligation enforceable against property of the original trust
1973 shall be enforceable to the same extent against the property when held by the second trust

1981 governed by the law of this state for the purpose of:
1982 (A) Administration, including administration of a trust whose governing law for
1983 purposes of administration has been changed to the law of this state;
1984 (B) Construction of the terms of the trust; or
1985 (C) Determining the meaning or effect of the terms of the trust.
1986 (r) This Code section shall not apply to charitable trusts."

1991 be valid as to such beneficiary to the extent of the proportion portion of trust property
1992 attributable to such beneficiary's contribution of which such beneficiary is the donor. This
1993 subsection shall not apply to a special needs trust established pursuant to 42 U.S.C.

2001 regardless of whether the discretion is expressed in the form of a standard of distribution,
2002 including, but not limited to, health, education, maintenance, and support, and whether
2003 such trustee or trust director is also a beneficiary. This Code section shall not apply to the

2005 contribution of which such beneficiary is the donor."
2006 SECTION 74.
2007 Said title is further amended by revising Code Section 53-12-82, relating to rules for trusts

2569 suitable under the circumstances:

2647 (1) The requirement shall be satisfied by retaining, transmitting, copying, or filing an
2648 electronic record that:

2650 form as an electronic record or as a certified paper copy under this Code section; and

1063 testing of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from the remains of the decedent and
1064 from any party in interest whose kinship to the decedent is in controversy for purposes
1065 of comparison and determination of the statistical likelihood of such kinship; provided,
H. B. 327
- 42 -

25 LC 48 1418
1066 however, that no DNA testing shall be ordered with respect to any party in interest whose
1067 kinship to the decedent was created or terminated by a decree of adoption, pursuant to
1068 subsection (a) of Code Section 19-8-19, unless the right of inheritance of such party in
1069 interest was not affected by the adoption, pursuant to subsection (b) of Code Section
1070 19-8-19, or if such party in interest was conceived by means of artificial insemination,
1071 in vitro fertilization, or other similar method of assisted reproduction; and provided,
1072 further, that, for purposes of this subsection, a decree of adoption shall include:
1073 (A) Any such decree entered pursuant to Article 1 of Chapter 8 of Title 19;
1074 (B) Any such decree recognized in this state pursuant to Code Section 19-8-22; or
1075 (C) A final order entered pursuant to Code Section 19-8-43.
1076 (2) The court may order the disinterment of the decedent's remains if reasonably
1077 necessary to obtain such DNA samples for testing under this subsection.
1078 (b) The An order pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section may be made entered only
1079 on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to all parties in interest, and such order
1080 shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the removal and testing of
1081 samples, and the person or persons by whom it is such removal and testing of DNA
1082 samples are to be made. When such motion is made prior to the birth of a child whose
1083 kinship to the decedent is in controversy, such order shall direct that the DNA testing be
1084 conducted as soon as medically feasible after the birth of such child and may stay the
1085 proceedings until after the child's birth except service of notice; provided, however, that
1086 the requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Code Section 53-2-1 shall remain
1087 applicable to such child. Such motion, when made by a party in interest, shall be supported
1088 by affidavit setting forth:
1089 (1) The factual basis for a reasonable belief that the party in interest whose kinship to the
1090 decedent is in controversy is or is not so related; and
H. B. 327
- 43 -

25 LC 48 1418
1091 (2) If disinterment of the decedent's remains is sought, the factual basis for a reasonable
1092 belief that reliable DNA samples from the decedent are not otherwise reasonably
1093 available from any other source.
1094 (c) Upon request of a party in interest to a proceeding under this article or as ordered by
1095 the court on its own motion in the exercise of its discretion, the movant shall, within ten
1096 days after such request is made or such order is entered, but in no event later than ten days
1097 prior to the date of a hearing at which such report may be introduced into evidence, deliver
1098 to all parties in interest a copy of a detailed written report of the tester and of any other
1099 expert or other qualified person involved in the determination of such statistical likelihood
1100 setting out his or her findings, including the results of all tests made and conclusions or
1101 opinions based thereon. Unless a party in interest objects in writing within seven days after
1102 receiving such report and prior to the date of such hearing, such report shall be admitted
1103 in evidence without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or
1104 accuracy. When a timely objection is filed, such report shall be admitted in evidence when
1105 offered by a duly qualified licensed practicing physician, duly qualified immunologist, or
1106 other duly qualified person; provided, however, that in all cases the court shall determine
1107 the number and qualifications of the experts. Other relevant evidence shall be admitted as
1108 is deemed appropriate by the court. To provide any party in interest an adequate
1109 opportunity to be heard or as otherwise appears reasonably necessary to a just
1110 determination in a proceeding under this article, the court shall grant a continuance of any
1111 such hearing. Upon motion of any party in interest or on the court's own motion, any
1112 hearing or trial held in a proceeding under this article may be held in closed court without
1113 any person other than those necessary to the proceeding being admitted.

1115 disinterment and reinterment of the remains of the decedent, if necessary, as well as the
1116 costs of providing the report, shall be assessed against and paid by the moving party, and
1117 the court may award such costs as part of its final decree; provided, however, that the
H. B. 327
- 44 -

25 LC 48 1418
1118 court may, in its discretion after all parties in interest have been given reasonable
1119 opportunity to be heard, cast all or part of such costs against one or more parties in
1120 interest upon entering a finding of fact that any such party has asserted in bad faith a
1121 position with respect to the kinship in controversy in a proceeding under this article or
1122 has failed unreasonably to cooperate with an order for DNA testing entered pursuant to
1123 this Code section. The costs of disinterment may include a reasonable fee for services
1124 provided by a cemetery company in connection therewith, subject to the limitation upon
1125 such charges imposed by subsection (d) of Code Section 10-14-17.
1126 (2) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court may, in
1127 its discretion after all parties in interest have been given reasonable opportunity to be
1128 heard, order reasonable fees of counsel, experts, and guardians ad litem and other costs
1129 of the proceeding, including pretrial proceedings, to be paid by the parties in interest in
1130 proportions and at times determined by the court.
1131 (3) The trier of fact shall receive without foundation or the need for third-party testimony
1132 evidence of the costs and fees provided for by this subsection, and the evidence so
1133 presented shall constitute prima-facie evidence of the amounts of the costs so incurred.
1134 Copies of bills for the obtaining and testing of DNA samples, including the costs of
1135 disinterment and reinterment of the remains of the decedent, if necessary, furnished to all
1136 parties in interest at least ten days prior to the date of a hearing at which such copies of
1137 bills may be introduced into evidence, are admissible in evidence to prove that the
1138 charges billed were reasonable, necessary, and customary; provided, however, that
1139 nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the right of a thorough and sifting
1140 cross-examination as to such evidence.
1141 (e) DNA testing performed pursuant to this Code section shall be conducted by a
1142 laboratory certified by the American Association of Blood Banks, shall be conducted so
1143 that the results meet the standards the American Association of Blood Banks requires in
1144 order for such results to be admitted as evidence in a court of law, and shall be performed
H. B. 327
- 45 -

1145 by a duly qualified licensed practicing physician, duly qualified immunologist, or other
1146 duly qualified person; provided, however, that in all cases the court before which
1147 proceedings on the estate are pending shall determine the number and qualifications of the
1148 experts.
1149 (f) An order for DNA testing entered pursuant to this Code section shall be enforceable by
1150 contempt; provided, however, that, if the movant refuses to submit to such an order, the
1151 court may, in its discretion after all parties in interest have been given reasonable
1152 opportunity to be heard, dismiss or strike the movant's pleadings upon motion by any party
1153 in interest or on the court's own motion.
1154 (g) Except as ordered by the court for good cause shown pursuant to subsection (b) of this
1155 Code section, the genetic material collected for DNA testing performed pursuant to this
1156 Code section:
1157 (1) If collected through the disinterment of the decedent's remains, shall be destroyed
1158 within a reasonable time as determined by the court;
1159 (2) If made available from a source other than through the disinterment of the decedent's
1160 remains, shall be destroyed or returned in the manner reasonably directed by such source
1161 or in accordance with such source's standard rules and regulations; and
1162 (3) Shall not be shared with any other person or entity except to the extent reasonably
1163 necessary for compliance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection.
1164 (h) The disinterment and reinterment of the decedent's remains in accordance with a court
1165 order entered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section:
1166 (1) Shall not require a permit under Code Section 12-3-52, 12-3-82, or 36-72-4 as a
1167 condition precedent to such disinterment;
1168 (2) Shall not require authorization under subsection (f) of Code Section 31-10-20 as a
1169 condition precedent to such disinterment or reinterment;
1170 (3) Shall not constitute a disturbance, destruction, defacing, mutilation, removal, or
1171 exposure of interred human remains under Code Section 31-21-6;
H. B. 327

1174 when such disinterment or reinterment is in an abandoned cemetery or burial ground, as
1175 defined in Code Section 36-72-2; provided, however, that nothing in Code Section
1176 36-72-15 shall affect the assessment, allocation, or payment of costs ordered by the court
1177 pursuant to subsection (d) of this Code section; and
1178 (6) May be done by any person who is or is able to be authorized to disinter the remains
1179 of a human body under Code Section 45-16-45 or subsection (b) of Code Section
1180 45-16-51; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall limit the persons whom
1181 the court may designate to perform such disinterment pursuant to subsection (b) of this
1182 Code section.
1183 (i) Any person disinterring or reinterring a decedent's remains in accordance with a court
1184 order entered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section shall be deemed to be a person
1185 having duties imposed upon that person relating to the possession or disposition of dead
1186 bodies while in the performance of said duties within the meaning of subsection (b) of
1187 Code Section 31-21-44.
1188 (j) DNA testing performed pursuant to this Code section shall be deemed to be genetic
1189 testing conducted to obtain information for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes within the
1190 meaning of subsection (a) of Code Section 33-54-3; provided, however, that DNA testing
1191 performed pursuant to this Code section may be conducted without written consent prior

1411 of such creditor's claim if the personal representative actually receives such notification of
1412 the claim or if such creditor files such notification with the probate court having
1413 jurisdiction over the decedent's estate or sends such notification of the claim by electronic
1414 transmission, other form of wire or wireless communication, or by first-class mail or

1429 are assets in the hands of the personal representative sufficient to pay such debts and if no
1430 claims of greater priority are unpaid, the assets shall be thus appropriated notwithstanding

1747 (i) The settlor shall have the power to direct the trustee in the management of such
1748 property and the provisions of Article 18 of this chapter shall apply so that the trustee

1814 an irrevocable trust, even if the modification or termination is inconsistent with a material
H. B. 327
- 71 -

25 LC 48 1418
1815 purpose of the trust, if the settlor and all qualified beneficiaries consent to such
1816 modification or termination and the trustee has received been given notice of the proposed
1817 modification or termination. A settlor's power to consent to such trust's modification or
1818 termination may be exercised by:

1820 power of attorney and the provisions of the trust;
1821 (2) The settlor's conservator with the approval of the court supervising the

1830 received been given notice of the proposed termination, and the court concludes that
1831 continuance of such trust is not necessary to achieve any material purpose of such trust."

1833 transfer to any other trust qualified for a charitable deduction under Sections 170(a),
1834 2055(a), or 2522(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, the trust may not be modified
1835 or terminated pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this Code section in a manner that

1837 charitable deduction."
1838 "(o) For purposes of subsection (b) of this Code section, notwithstanding the provisions
1839 of Code Section 53-12-8, all qualified beneficiaries shall represent and bind all other

1842 such other beneficiary objects to the representation."
1843 SECTION 71.
1844 Said title is further amended by revising Code Section 53-12-62, relating to power of trustee
1845 to invade principal of original trust, as follows:
1846 "53-12-62.
1847 (a) As used in this Code section, the term:
1848 (1) 'Original trust' refers to the trust from which principal is being distributed.
1849 (2) 'Second trust' refers to the trust to which assets are being distributed from the original
1850 trust, whether a separate trust or an amended version of the original trust.
1851 (b)(1) As used in this subsection, the term 'current beneficiary' means a person who, on
1852 the date of distribution to the second trust, is a distributee or permissible distributee of
1853 trust income or principal.
1854 (2) Unless the original trust instrument expressly provides otherwise, a trustee, other than
1855 a person who contributed property donor to the trust, with the discretionary authority to
1856 invade the distribute income or principal of the original trust to make distributions to or
1857 for the benefit of one or more of the beneficiaries may also, independently or with court
1858 approval, exercise such authority by distributing all or part of the income or principal of
1859 the original trust subject to such discretion to a trustee of a second trust; provided,
1860 however, that the second trust shall not include as a:
1861 (A) Current beneficiary any person that is not a current beneficiary of income or
1862 principal of the original trust; or
1863 (B) Beneficiary any person that is not a beneficiary of the original trust.
1864 (c) Except as provided in this Code section, a trustee may exercise the power to invade the
1865 distribute income or principal of the original trust under subsection (b) of this Code section
1866 without the consent of the settlor or the beneficiaries of the original trust if such trustee
H. B. 327
- 73 -

25 LC 48 1418
1867 provides written notice of such trustee's decision to exercise the power to such settlor, if
1868 living, any trust director, and those persons then entitled to annual reports from the trustee
1869 of the original trust under subsection (b) of Code Section 53-12-243, taking into account
1870 the provisions of the original trust and subsections (c) and (d) of Code Section 53-12-243.
1871 Such notice shall:
1872 (1) Describe the manner in which such trustee intends to exercise such power;
1873 (2) Specify the date such trustee proposes to distribute to the second trust; and
1874 (3) Be delivered at least 30 days before the proposed distribution to the second trust.

1876 trust under subsection (b) of this Code section shall be by an instrument in a writing, signed
1877 and acknowledged by the trustee, and filed with the records of the original trust.
1878 (e) The exercise of the power to invade the distribute income or principal of the original
1879 trust under subsection (b) of this Code section shall not extend the permissible period of
1880 the rule against perpetuities that applies to such original trust.
1881 (f) The exercise of the power to invade the distribute income or principal of the original
1882 trust under subsection (b) of this Code section by a trustee who is also a beneficiary shall
1883 be subject to the limitations of Code Section 53-12-270.
1884 (g) This Code section shall not be construed to abridge the right of any trustee who has a
1885 power of invasion to distribute property income or principal in further trust that arises
1886 under any other law or under common law, and nothing in this Code section shall be
1887 construed to imply that the common law does not permit the exercise of a power to invade
1888 the distribute income or principal of a trust in the manner authorized under subsection (b)
1889 of this Code section.
1890 (h) A second trust may confer a power of appointment upon a beneficiary of the original
1891 trust to whom or for the benefit of whom the trustee has the power to distribute the income
1892 or principal of such original trust. For purposes of this subsection, the permissible
H. B. 327

25 LC 48 1418
1893 appointees of the power of appointment conferred upon a beneficiary may include persons
1894 who are not beneficiaries of such original trust or second trust.
1895 (i) If any contribution to the original trust qualified for the annual exclusion under Section
1896 2503(b) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, as it existed on February 1, 2018, the marital
1897 deduction under Section 2056(a) or 2523(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, as it
1898 existed on February 1, 2018, or the charitable deduction under Section 170(a), 642(c),

1902 benefit that would be lost by the existence of the authorized trustee's authority under
1903 subsection (b) of this Code section for income, gift, estate, or generation-skipping transfer
1904 tax purposes under the federal Internal Revenue Code, then the authorized trustee shall not
1905 have the power to distribute the income or principal of a trust pursuant to subsection (b) of
1906 this Code section in a manner that would prevent the contribution to the original trust from
1907 qualifying for such exclusion, deduction, or other tax benefit or would reduce such
1908 exclusion, deduction, or other tax benefit that was originally claimed with respect to such
1909 contribution.
1910 (j) The exercise of the power to invade the distribute income or principal of the original
1911 trust under subsection (b) of this Code section shall be subject to the following limitations
1912 with respect to any portion of the original trust or second trust that does or will qualify as
1913 a grantor trust with respect to a donor:
1914 (1) The second trust need not qualify as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes,
1915 even if the original trust does qualify as a grantor trust, except that if such original trust
1916 qualifies as a grantor trust because of the application of Section 672(f)(2)(A) of the
1917 federal Internal Revenue Code, as it existed on February 1, 2018, such second trust may
1918 not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the original trust
1919 instrument, would have prevented such original trust from qualifying under such section;
H. B. 327
- 75 -

25 LC 48 1418
1920 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section, when the original trust
1921 does not qualify as a grantor trust and the donor is alive, the terms of the second trust
1922 shall not provide for a power of disposition that is not exempt from the application of
1923 subsection (a) of Section 674 of the federal Internal Revenue Code unless an adverse
1924 party, as defined in subsection (a) of Section 672 of the federal Internal Revenue Code,
1925 approves or consents to the inclusion of the power in the second trust. Subject to
1926 paragraph (3) of this subsection, the second trust may qualify as a grantor trust pursuant
1927 to other sections of the federal Internal Revenue Code;
1928 (2)(3) Unless the settlor the donor objects in a writing delivered to the trustee before the
1929 date the trustee proposes to distribute from the original trust to the second trust, such
1930 second trust may qualify as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes, even if such
1931 original trust does not so qualify, except that if such original trust does not so qualify and
1932 such second trust will so qualify, in whole or in part, with respect to the settlor donor,
1933 such second trust shall grant such settlor donor or another person a power that would
1934 cause such second trust to cease to be a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes; and
1935 (3)(4) When both the original trust and the second trust qualify as grantor trusts for
1936 federal income tax purposes and such original trust grants the settlor donor or another
1937 person the power to cause such original trust to cease to be a grantor trust, such second
1938 trust shall grant an equivalent power to the settlor donor or another person unless such
1939 settlor donor objects in a writing delivered to the trustee before the date the trustee
1940 proposes to distribute from such original trust to such second trust.
1941 For purposes of this subsection, a trust that is a 'grantor trust' or that qualifies as a 'grantor
1942 trust' shall mean a trust, or portion of a trust, of which the donor is treated as the owner of
1943 the trust property for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Subchapter J of the federal
1944 Internal Revenue Code.
1945 (k) During any period when the original trust owns stock in a Subchapter 'S' corporation
1946 as defined in Section 1361(a)(1) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, as it existed on

1949 corporation to a second trust that is not a permitted shareholder under Section 1361(c)(2)
1950 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, as it existed on February 1, 2018.
1951 (l) A trustee or other person that reasonably relies on the validity of a distribution of
1952 property of the original trust to the second trust under subsection (b) of this Code section
1953 or any other law or common law shall not be liable for any action or failure to act as a
1954 result of such reliance.
1955 (m) This Code section shall not create or imply a duty for a trustee or trust director to
1956 exercise a power conferred by this Code section.
1957 (n) If exercise of the power to invade the distribute income or principal of the original trust
1958 would be effective under subsection (b) of this Code section except that the second trust
1959 in part does not comply with this Code section, such exercise of the power shall be
1960 effective, a provision in such second trust that is not permitted under this Code section shall
1961 be void to the extent necessary to comply with this Code section, and a provision required
1962 by this Code section to be in such second trust that is not contained in such second trust
1963 shall be deemed to be included in such second trust to the extent necessary to comply with
1964 this Code section.
1965 (o) The settlor donor of the original trust shall be deemed to be the settlor donor of the
1966 second trust with respect to the portion of the income or principal of the original trust
1967 subject to the exercise of the power to invade distribute the principal of such original trust
1968 under subsection (b) of this Code section. The settlor of the second trust shall be the
1969 person who creates the second trust, including a testator in the case of a testamentary trust;
1970 provided, however, that, if the trustee of the original trust creates the second trust, the
1971 settlor of the original trust shall be deemed to be the settlor of the second trust.
1972 (p) A debt, liability, or other obligation enforceable against property of the original trust
1973 shall be enforceable to the same extent against the property when held by the second trust

1979 principal place of administration has been changed to this state; or
1980 (2) Provides in its trust instrument that it is governed by the law of this state or is
1981 governed by the law of this state for the purpose of:
1982 (A) Administration, including administration of a trust whose governing law for
1983 purposes of administration has been changed to the law of this state;
1984 (B) Construction of the terms of the trust; or
1985 (C) Determining the meaning or effect of the terms of the trust.
1986 (r) This Code section shall not apply to charitable trusts."

1991 be valid as to such beneficiary to the extent of the proportion portion of trust property
1992 attributable to such beneficiary's contribution of which such beneficiary is the donor. This
1993 subsection shall not apply to a special needs trust established pursuant to 42 U.S.C.
1994 Sections Section 1396p(d)(4)(A) or 1396p(d)(4)(C)."

2001 regardless of whether the discretion is expressed in the form of a standard of distribution,
2002 including, but not limited to, health, education, maintenance, and support, and whether
2003 such trustee or trust director is also a beneficiary. This Code section shall not apply to the
2004 extent of the proportion portion of trust property attributable to the beneficiary's
2005 contribution of which such beneficiary is the donor."
2006 SECTION 74.
2007 Said title is further amended by revising Code Section 53-12-82, relating to rules for trusts
2008 and consideration of assets of an inter vivos marital trust following death, as follows:
