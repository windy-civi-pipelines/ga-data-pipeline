36 county-wide service, the county share of such funding shall be borne by the
37 unincorporated residents, individuals, and property owners that receive the service.

55 to the strategy that:
56 (I) Identifies the total amount of funds received by the county from the funding
57 sources utilized under division (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for
