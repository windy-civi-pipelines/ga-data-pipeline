14 In the development of a service delivery strategy, the following criteria shall be met:
15 (1) The strategy shall promote the delivery of local government services in the most
16 efficient, effective, and responsive manner. The strategy shall identify steps which will
- 1 -

25 LC 44 3173S
17 be taken to remediate or avoid overlapping and unnecessary competition and duplication
18 of service delivery and shall identify the time frame in which such steps shall be taken.
19 When a municipality provides a service at a higher level than the base level of service
20 provided throughout the geographic area of the county by the county, such service shall
21 not be considered a duplication of the county service;
22 (2)(A) The strategy shall provide that water or sewer fees charged to customers located
23 outside the geographic boundaries of a service provider shall not be arbitrarily higher
24 than the fees charged to customers receiving such service which are located within the
25 geographic boundaries of the service provider.
26 (B) If a governing authority disputes the reasonableness of water and sewer rate
27 differentials imposed within its jurisdiction by another governing authority, that
28 disputing governing authority may hold a public hearing for the purpose of reviewing
29 the rate differential. Following the preparation of a rate study by a qualified engineer,
30 the governing authority may challenge the arbitrary rate differentials on behalf of its
31 residents in a court of competent jurisdiction. Prior to such challenge, the dispute shall
32 be submitted to some form of alternative dispute resolution;
33 (3)(A) The strategy shall ensure that the cost of any service which a county provides
34 primarily for the benefit of the unincorporated area of the county shall be borne by the
35 unincorporated area residents, individuals, and property owners who receive the
36 service. Further, when the county and one or more municipalities jointly fund a
37 county-wide service, the county share of such funding shall be borne by the
38 unincorporated residents, individuals, and property owners that receive the service.
39 (B) Such funding shall be derived from:
40 (i) Any one or more of the following sources:
41 (i)(I) Special service districts created by the county in which ad valorem property
42 taxes, assessments, or user fees are levied or imposed;
43 (ii)(II) Grants;

49 or and fees to the extent such amount is derived from incorporated areas of the
50 county; and
51 (iv)(IV) Revenues apportioned to the county as part of an intergovernmental
52 agreement from the county and one or more municipalities; or
53 (v)(ii) Through such other mechanism agreed upon by the parties approving the
54 strategy which complies with the intent of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; and.
55 (C)(i) The strategy shall require the county to provide an annual report to each party
56 to the strategy that:
57 (I) Identifies the total amount of funds received by the county from the funding
58 sources utilized under division (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for
59 the provision of county services provided primarily for the benefit of the
60 unincorporated area of the county and the county's share of any countywide service
61 funded with one or more municipalities; and
62 (II) The total cost to the county of providing the services described in
63 subdivision (I) of this division.
64 (ii) The provisions of this subparagraph shall not require any party to the strategy to
65 establish separate accounts for such funds; and
66 (4)(A) Local governments within the same county shall, if necessary, amend their land
67 use plans so that such plans are compatible and nonconflicting, or, as an alternative,
68 they shall adopt a single land use plan for the unincorporated and incorporated areas of
69 the county.

81 approved strategy:

83 (2) In the event of the creation, abolition, or consolidation of local governments;
84 (3) When the existing service delivery strategy agreement expires; and
85 (4) Whenever the county and affected municipalities agree to revise the strategy.

88 strategy, an amendment to the strategy limited to such changed service or services or
89 revenue distribution arrangements between only those specific local governments may
90 be submitted solely by the affected local governments and without the approval of the
91 other nonimpacted county and affected municipalities in the county whose approval
92 would otherwise be required under subsection (b) of Code Section 36-70-25.
93 (2) Any amendments to the approved strategy or revenue distribution arrangement which
