26 SECTION 2.
27 Article 2 of Chapter 70 of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to
28 service delivery, is amended by revising Code Section 36-70-24, relating to criteria for
29 service delivery strategy, as such Code section becomes effective on January 1, 2026, as
30 follows:
31 "36-70-24.
32 In the development of a service delivery strategy, the following criteria shall be met:
33 (1) The strategy shall promote the delivery of local government services in the most
34 efficient, effective, and responsive manner. The strategy shall identify steps which will
35 be taken to remediate or avoid overlapping and unnecessary competition and duplication
36 of service delivery and shall identify the time frame in which such steps shall be taken.
37 When a municipality provides a service at a higher level than the base level of service
38 provided throughout the geographic area of the county by the county, such service shall
39 not be considered a duplication of the county service;
40 (2)(A) The strategy shall provide that water or sewer fees charged to customers located
41 outside the geographic boundaries of a service provider shall not be arbitrarily higher
- 2 -

25 HB 513/SCSFA
42 than the fees charged to customers receiving such service which are located within the
43 geographic boundaries of the service provider.
44 (B) If a governing authority disputes the reasonableness of water and sewer rate
45 differentials imposed within its jurisdiction by another governing authority, that
46 disputing governing authority may hold a public hearing for the purpose of reviewing
47 the rate differential. Following the preparation of a rate study by a qualified engineer,
48 the governing authority may challenge the arbitrary rate differentials on behalf of its
49 residents in a court of competent jurisdiction. Prior to such challenge, the dispute shall
50 be submitted to some form of alternative dispute resolution;
51 (3)(A) The strategy shall ensure that the cost of any service which a county provides
52 primarily for the benefit of the unincorporated area of the county shall be borne by the
53 unincorporated area residents, individuals, and property owners who receive the
54 service. Further, when the county and one or more municipalities jointly fund a
55 county-wide service, the county share of such funding shall be borne by the
56 unincorporated residents, individuals, and property owners that receive the service.
57 (B) Such funding shall be derived from:
58 (i) Any one or more of the following sources:
59 (i)(I) Special service districts created by the county in which ad valorem property
60 taxes, assessments, or user fees are levied or imposed;
61 (ii)(II) Grants;
62 (iii)(III) Any one or more of the following taxes and fees: solid waste franchise
63 fees, cable Cable franchise fees, alcohol excise taxes, alcohol licensing fees,
64 financial institution taxes, hotel-motel taxes, occupation taxes, railroad equipment
65 taxes, insurance premium taxes, rental car excise taxes, impact fees, stormwater
66 fees, zoning fees, or title ad valorem taxes, but excluding any amounts of such taxes
67 or and fees to the extent such amount is derived from incorporated areas of the
68 county; and
- 3 -

25 HB 513/SCSFA
69 (iv)(IV) Revenues apportioned to the county as part of an intergovernmental
70 agreement from the county and one or more municipalities; or
71 (v)(ii) Through such other mechanism agreed upon by the parties approving the
72 strategy which complies with the intent of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; and.
73 (C)(i) The strategy shall require the county to provide an annual report to each party
74 to the strategy that:
75 (I) Identifies the total amount of funds received by the county from the funding
76 sources utilized under division (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for
77 the provision of county services provided primarily for the benefit of the
78 unincorporated area of the county and the county's share of any countywide service
79 funded with one or more municipalities; and
80 (II) The total cost to the county of providing the services described in
81 subdivision (I) of this division.
82 (ii) The provisions of this subparagraph shall not require any party to the strategy to
83 establish separate accounts for such funds; and
84 (4)(A) Local governments within the same county shall, if necessary, amend their land
85 use plans so that such plans are compatible and nonconflicting, or, as an alternative,
86 they shall adopt a single land use plan for the unincorporated and incorporated areas of
87 the county.
88 (B) The provision of extraterritorial water and sewer services by any jurisdiction shall
89 be consistent with all applicable land use plans and ordinances."
