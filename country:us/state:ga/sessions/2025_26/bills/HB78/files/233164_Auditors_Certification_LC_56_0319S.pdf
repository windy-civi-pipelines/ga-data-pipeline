The Honorable John Carson, Chairman
House Retirement Committee
State Capitol, Room 401-E
Atlanta, GA 30334
SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
Substitute to House Bill 78 (LC 56 0319S)
Dear Chairman Carson:
This substitute bill would amend provisions relating to the Public Retirement Systems Investment
Authority Law. Specifically, this bill would increase the limits for the percentage of assets that the
Employees' Retirement System and the Georgia Firefighters' Pension Fund may invest in alternative
investments.
Current law authorizes eligible large retirement systems to invest a certain percentage of their assets in
alternative investments. For most retirement systems, the limit is ten percent of the system's assets.
However, the statute has set different limits for specified retirement systems. Currently, the Employees'
Retirement System and the Teachers Retirement System may only invest a maximum of five percent of
assets in alternative investments, while the Georgia Firefighters' Pension Fund and the Peace Officers'
Annuity and Benefit Fund may invest up to 15 percent of its assets in alternative investments.
This substitute bill would increase the limits for both the Employees' Retirement System and the Georgia
Firefighters' Pension Fund. If this substitute bill is enacted, the limit for the Employees' Retirement
System would be increased to ten percent and the limit for the Georgia Firefighters' Pension Fund would
be increased to 20 percent.
This is to certify that this substitute bill is a nonfiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement
Systems Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
