of the 114th
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Article 3 of Chapter 3 of Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated,

3 Georgia; to provide legislative findings and declarations; to provide for related matters; to
4 repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.
5 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
6 SECTION 1.
7 The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
8 (1) The colorful history and traditions of the State of Georgia are inextricably associated
9 with the food traditions of corn and among the many legacies of this proud heritage is the
10 delicious bread known as cornbread;
11 (2) Relied upon by indigenous people to sustain themselves, cornbread has transcended
12 its humble origins to take a place of honor at such events as the Prater's Mill Country Fair
13 in Whitfield County;
14 (3) With thousands of participants and visitors, such celebrations include cornbread
15 cooked on a wood-burning stove and served with collard greens and pinto beans;

16 (4) Corn is grown, ground, and made into cornmeal at historic mills like Prater's Mill,
17 Berry College Mill, and Ogeechee River Mill and modern mills like Southeastern Mills and
18 Logan Turnpike Mill;
19 (5) Cornmeal is then sold in stores and served in eating establishments throughout the
20 state, and cornbread is enjoyed by young and old at home and in restaurants;
21 (6) Cornbread enjoys a singular stature in Georgia history and culture that is rivaled only
22 by its undeniable appeal as a versatile and satisfying food; and
23 (7) Accordingly, it is abundantly fitting and proper that cornbread be designated as the
24 official Georgia state bread so as to fully recognize the importance of this product to this
25 state.
26 SECTION 2.
27 Article 3 of Chapter 3 of Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to other
28 state symbols, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
29 "50-3-94.
30 Cornbread is designated as the official Georgia state bread."
31 SECTION 3.
32 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
