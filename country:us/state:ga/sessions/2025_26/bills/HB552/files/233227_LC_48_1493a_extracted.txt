15 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
H. B. 552

25 LC 48 1493
16 (1) State and local government entities and governing bodies and officers, employees, and
17 agents thereof too frequently fail to respect and to recognize the fundamental constitutional
18 rights of parents to raise their children and to make decisions regarding their children as
19 codified and recognized by subsection (d) of Code Section 20-2-786 of the Official Code
20 of Georgia Annotated, which provides that "No state or local government entity, governing
21 body, or any officer, employee, or agent thereof may infringe on the fundamental right of
22 a parent to direct the upbringing and education of his or her minor child without
23 demonstrating that such action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state
24 interest and that such action is narrowly tailored and is not otherwise served by less
25 restrictive means";
26 (2) In such instances, the rights of parents and the rights of children are infringed upon and
27 the rights of parents to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights are chilled
28 unnecessarily;
29 (3) In such instances, finite and valuable resources of state and local government entities
30 and governing bodies are wasted without corresponding benefits to the people of the State
31 of Georgia;
32 (4) Providing definitions and protocols will assist state and local government entities and
33 governing bodies and officers, employees, and agents thereof in determining the absence
34 or the existence of a compelling state interest necessary to allow infringement on the
35 fundamental constitutional rights of a parent;
36 (5) Amending Code Section 16-5-70 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, which
37 provides for the offense of cruelty to children, to be consistent with Code Section 20-2-786
38 and providing parents and guardians with immunity from criminal liability when they take
39 action or make decisions regarding their child in the absence of a compelling state interest
40 otherwise serves the interests of the state, parents, and children;
H. B. 552

25 LC 48 1493
41 (6) Providing government actors in law enforcement and the Division of Family and
42 Children Services with immunity from criminal and civil liability when following the
43 protocol established hereby serves the interests of the state, parents, and children; and
44 (7) Amending Code Section 16-5-60 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating
45 to the offense of reckless conduct, is necessary to address the vagueness and ambiguity
46 therein as held by the Supreme Court of Georgia; additionally, actions and decisions by
47 parents and guardians as provided by Code Section 16-5-70 are not included within the
48 offense of reckless conduct, and amending Code Section 15-11-2 to exclude from the
49 definition of neglect certain actions and decisions by parents and guardians is necessary for
50 consistency between and among statutes addressing child welfare and safety and the
51 conduct of parents and guardians and to define such actions and decisions and provide
52 examples when parents are provided immunity from criminal liability for reasonable
53 parental decisions regarding a child.
54 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that:
55 (1) Children are kept safe;
56 (2) The fundamental constitutional rights of parents and of their children are neither
57 infringed upon nor chilled;
58 (3) State and local government entities and governing bodies and officers, employees, and
59 agents thereof are provided specific protocols to follow which will protect children;
60 alleviate unnecessary consumption of resources by state and local government entities and
61 governing bodies and officers, employees, and agents thereof; and avoid the negative
62 unintended consequences that impact parents and children; and
63 (4) State and local government entities and governing bodies and officers, employees, and
64 agents thereof are provided corresponding civil and criminal immunity, provided that the
65 protocol provided herein is followed.
