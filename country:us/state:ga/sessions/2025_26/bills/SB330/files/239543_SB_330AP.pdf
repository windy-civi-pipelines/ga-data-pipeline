16 (2) "Homestead" means homestead as defined and qualified in Code Section 48-5-40 of
17 the O.C.G.A., as amended, with the additional qualification that it shall include not more
18 than five contiguous acres of homestead property.
19 (3) "Senior citizen" means a person who is 65 years of age or older on or before
20 January 1 of the year in which application for the exemption under subsection (b) of this
21 section is made.
22 (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, each resident of the City
23 of Atlanta independent school district who is a senior citizen is granted an exemption on
24 that person's homestead from all City of Atlanta independent school district ad valorem
25 taxes for educational purposes in the amount of $50,000.00 of the assessed value of that
26 homestead. The value of that property in excess of such exempted amount shall remain
27 subject to taxation.
28 (2) The maximum amount of homestead exemptions granted under this Act shall not
29 exceed $487,804,878.00 in the aggregate annually. Upon the closing of the books for the

31 of Atlanta or its designee shall calculate the aggregate amount of homestead exemptions
32 claimed under this Act for such taxable year. If such total is equal to or less than
33 $487,804,878.00 in the aggregate for that taxable year, then each senior citizen claiming
34 a homestead exemption under this Act shall receive the full value of such exemption. If
35 the total exceeds $487,804,878.00 in the aggregate for that taxable year, the governing
36 authority or its designee shall calculate the amount by which the total exceeds
37 $487,804,878.00 and shall reduce the amount of homestead exemptions claimed by such
38 senior citizens in an amount equal to such difference so that the total amount of
39 homestead exemptions being claimed under this Act for such taxable year shall equal
40 $487,804,878.00. Such reduction shall be applied on a proportionate basis.
41 (c) A person shall not receive the homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this
42 section unless such person or person's agent files an application with the governing authority

43 of the City of Atlanta, or the designee thereof, giving the person's age and such additional
44 information relative to receiving such exemption as will enable the governing authority of
45 the City of Atlanta, or the designee thereof, to make a determination regarding the initial and
46 continuing eligibility of such person for such exemption. The governing authority of the City
47 of Atlanta, or the designee thereof, shall provide application forms for this purpose.
48 (d) The exemption shall be claimed and returned as provided in Code Section 48-5-50.1 of
49 the O.C.G.A., as amended. The exemption shall be automatically renewed from year to year
50 as long as the person granted the homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this section
51 occupies the residence as a homestead. After a person has filed the proper application as
52 provided in subsection (c) of this section, it shall not be necessary to make application
53 thereafter for any year, and the exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It
54 shall be the duty of any person granted the homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this
55 section to notify the governing authority of the City of Atlanta, or the designee thereof, in the
56 event that such person for any reason becomes ineligible for such exemption.

59 taxes for municipal purposes, or county school district ad valorem taxes for educational
60 purposes. The homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall be in
