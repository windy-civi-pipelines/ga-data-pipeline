12 serving the legislature;
13 (3) A legislative member who demonstrates civility chooses words carefully and
14 understands that his or her actions or communications reflect directly upon the legislative

16 (4) Civility requires an acknowledgment of opposing views and the right of others to
17 hold those views. It does not suggest or require acceptance or agreement with those
18 opinions;
19 (5) "Civility is claiming and caring for one's identity, needs, and beliefs without
20 degrading someone else's in the process," said Cassandra Dahnke and Tomas Spath,
21 founders of the Institute for Civility;
22 (6) The Georgia Municipal Association became the first Organization of Civility, with
23 an inaugural group of 77 cities with the "City of Civility" designation, to encourage
24 elected officials to acknowledge their responsibility in modeling open, free, and vigorous
25 debate while maintaining the highest standards of civility, honesty, and mutual respect,
26 not only with each other but with those they serve;
27 (7) Civility includes the following practices:
28 (A) Be considerate of others' opinions. It is okay to agree to disagree;
29 (B) Manage your emotions. Get curious instead of furious;
30 (C) A silent voice is not always a weak voice. Sometimes it is okay not to respond;
31 (D) Be kind. Make your point about the issue, not the person;
32 (E) Actively listen to learn how to engage respectfully;
33 (F) Think about the impact of your actions and not the intent;
34 (G) Ask questions to learn. Answer questions with respect;
35 (H) Remember to quit taking it personally; and
36 (I) Have empathy. Just because you have not experienced it does not mean it does
37 not exist;
38 (8) Civility is key to a successful legislative session; and
39 (9) The legislators of the State of Georgia desire to embrace civility and manifest its
40 aspiration to practice and support civility.
