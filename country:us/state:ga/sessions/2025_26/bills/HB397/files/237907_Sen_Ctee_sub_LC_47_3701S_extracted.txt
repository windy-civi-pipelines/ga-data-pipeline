248 establish additional drop boxes totaling the lesser of either one drop box for every
249 100,000 active registered voters in the county or the number of advance voting locations
250 in the county. Any additional drop boxes shall be evenly geographically distributed by
251 population in the county. Drop boxes established pursuant to this Code section shall be
252 established at the office of the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk or inside
253 locations at which advance voting, as set forth in subsection (d) of Code Section
254 21-2-385, is conducted in the applicable primary, election, or runoff and may be open
255 during the hours of advance voting at that location. Such drop boxes shall be closed
256 when advance voting is not being conducted at that location. All drop boxes shall be
257 closed when the advance voting period ends, as set forth in subsection (d) of Code
258 Section 21-2-385. The drop box location shall have adequate lighting and be under
259 constant surveillance by an election official or his or her designee, law enforcement
260 official, or licensed security guard. During an emergency declared by the Governor
261 pursuant to Code Section 38-3-51, drop boxes may be located outside the office of the
262 board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk or outside of locations at which advance voting
263 is taking place, subject to the other limitations of this Code section.
264 (2) The opening slot of a drop box shall not allow ballots to be tampered with or

266 may damage ballots to be poured into the drop box. A drop box shall be labeled
267 'OFFICIAL ABSENTEE BALLOT DROP BOX' and shall clearly display the signage
268 developed by the Secretary of State pertaining to Georgia law with regard to who is
269 allowed to return absentee ballots and destroying, defacing, or delaying delivery of
270 ballots.
271 (3) The board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk shall arrange for the collecting and
272 return of ballots deposited at each drop box at the conclusion of each day where advance
273 voting takes place. Collection of ballots from a drop box shall be made by a team of at
274 least two people. Any person collecting ballots from a drop box shall have sworn an oath
- 11 -
25 LC 47 3701S
275 in the same form as the oath for poll officers set forth in Code Section 21-2-95. The
276 collection team shall complete and sign a ballot transfer form upon removing the ballots
277 from the drop box which shall include the date, time, location, number of ballots,
278 confirmation that the drop box was locked after the removal of the ballots, and the
279 identity of each person collecting the ballots. The collection team shall then immediately
280 transfer the ballots to the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk, who shall process
281 and store the ballots in the same manner as absentee ballots returned by mail are
282 processed and stored. The board of registrars, absentee ballot clerk, or a designee of the
283 board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk shall sign the ballot transfer form upon receipt
284 of the ballots from the collection team. Such form shall be considered a public record
285 pursuant to Code Section 50-18-70.
286 (4) At the beginning of voting at each advance location where a drop box is present, the
287 manager of the advance voting location shall open the drop box and confirm on the
288 reconciliation form for that advance voting location that the drop box is empty. If the
289 drop box is not empty, the manager shall secure the contents of the drop box and
290 immediately inform the election superintendent, board of registrars, or absentee ballot
291 clerk, who shall inform the Secretary of State.
292 (5) At each advance voting location where a drop box is present, the board of registrars
293 or absentee ballot clerk shall initiate video surveillance and recording of such location
294 upon the conclusion of voting on each day of advance voting. Such surveillance shall
295 ensure that a visual record is made of each such drop box. In the event that constant and
296 direct video surveillance of a drop box is not possible when advance voting is not
297 occurring, such ballot box shall be removed from areas of public access, locked, and
298 rendered inoperable so that no absentee ballots may be inserted into it. A recording of
299 all such video surveillance shall be retained in the same manner as provided for in
300 subsection (a) of Code Section 21-2-390. A board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk
301 may livestream to the public any such video surveillance.

252 established at the office of the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk or inside
253 locations at which advance voting, as set forth in subsection (d) of Code Section
254 21-2-385, is conducted in the applicable primary, election, or runoff and may be open
255 during the hours of advance voting at that location. Such drop boxes shall be closed
256 when advance voting is not being conducted at that location. All drop boxes shall be
257 closed when the advance voting period ends, as set forth in subsection (d) of Code
258 Section 21-2-385. The drop box location shall have adequate lighting and be under
259 constant surveillance by an election official or his or her designee, law enforcement

268 developed by the Secretary of State pertaining to Georgia law with regard to who is
269 allowed to return absentee ballots and destroying, defacing, or delaying delivery of

272 return of ballots deposited at each drop box at the conclusion of each day where advance
273 voting takes place. Collection of ballots from a drop box shall be made by a team of at
274 least two people. Any person collecting ballots from a drop box shall have sworn an oath
- 11 -

25 LC 47 3701S

277 from the drop box which shall include the date, time, location, number of ballots,
278 confirmation that the drop box was locked after the removal of the ballots, and the
279 identity of each person collecting the ballots. The collection team shall then immediately
280 transfer the ballots to the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk, who shall process
281 and store the ballots in the same manner as absentee ballots returned by mail are
282 processed and stored. The board of registrars, absentee ballot clerk, or a designee of the
283 board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk shall sign the ballot transfer form upon receipt
284 of the ballots from the collection team. Such form shall be considered a public record
285 pursuant to Code Section 50-18-70.

287 manager of the advance voting location shall open the drop box and confirm on the
288 reconciliation form for that advance voting location that the drop box is empty. If the
289 drop box is not empty, the manager shall secure the contents of the drop box and
290 immediately inform the election superintendent, board of registrars, or absentee ballot
291 clerk, who shall inform the Secretary of State.
292 (5) At each advance voting location where a drop box is present, the board of registrars
293 or absentee ballot clerk shall initiate video surveillance and recording of such location
294 upon the conclusion of voting on each day of advance voting. Such surveillance shall
295 ensure that a visual record is made of each such drop box. In the event that constant and
296 direct video surveillance of a drop box is not possible when advance voting is not
297 occurring, such ballot box shall be removed from areas of public access, locked, and
298 rendered inoperable so that no absentee ballots may be inserted into it. A recording of
299 all such video surveillance shall be retained in the same manner as provided for in
300 subsection (a) of Code Section 21-2-390. A board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk
301 may livestream to the public any such video surveillance.

456 and general elections; and the provisions of this chapter relating to general primaries and

467 precede the special election.
468 (b) At least 29 60 days shall intervene between the call of a special primary and the
469 holding of same, and at least 29 45 days shall intervene between the call of a special

479 presidential preference primary, state-wide general primary, state-wide general election,
480 state-wide special primary, or state-wide special election but conducted completely
