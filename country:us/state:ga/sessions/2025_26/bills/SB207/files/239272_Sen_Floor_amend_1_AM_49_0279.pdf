1285 provided in the Constitution and Code Section 42-9-42, provided that the offense was not
1286 a serious violent felony as such term is defined in Code Section 17-10-6.1 or a sexual
1287 offense as such term is defined in Code Section 17-10-6.2, and provided, further, that
1288 such individual has not been convicted of any crime in any jurisdiction, excluding any
1289 conviction for a nonserious traffic offense, since the pardon was granted, and provided,

1292 Such court shall maintain jurisdiction over the case for this limited purpose and duration.
1293 Such petition shall be served on the prosecuting attorney. If a hearing is requested, such
1294 hearing shall be held within 90 days of the filing of the petition. If the court finds that the
1295 criteria for such petition are met, the court shall grant an order restricting such criminal
1296 history record information. The court shall hear evidence and shall grant an order
1297 restricting such criminal history record information if it determines that the harm
1298 otherwise resulting to the individual clearly outweighs the public's interest in the criminal
1299 history record information being publicly available."
1300 "(k)(1) Upon an approved restriction, by order or application, pursuant to this Code
1301 section, the prosecuting attorney of the relevant case shall, within 30 days, restrict access

1305 individual who has a record restricted pursuant to Code Section 17-10-21 or this Code
1306 section or an individual who has been cited for a criminal offense but was not arrested
1307 and the charged offense was subsequently dismissed, nolle prossed, or adjudicated as a
1308 violation of a local ordinance may petition the court with original jurisdiction over the
1309 offenses in the county where the clerk of court is located for an order to seal all criminal
1310 history record information maintained by the clerk of court for such individual's charged
1311 offense. Notice of such petition shall be sent to the clerk of court and the prosecuting
- 51 -

25 Sen Floor Amend 1 AM 49 0279
1312 attorney. A notice sent by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery shall
1313 be sufficient notice.
1314 (2) The court shall order all criminal history record information in the custody of the
1315 clerk of court, including within any index, to be restricted and unavailable to the public
1316 if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:
1317 (A) The criminal history record information has been restricted pursuant to this Code
1318 section; and
1319 (B) The harm otherwise resulting to the privacy of the individual clearly outweighs the
1320 public interest in the criminal history record information being publicly available.
1321 (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, the court shall order all criminal
1322 history record information in the custody of the clerk of court, including within any
1323 index, to be restricted and unavailable to the public if the criminal history record has been
1324 restricted pursuant to paragraph (7) of subsection (j) of this Code section.
1325 (4) Within 60 days of the court's order, the clerk of court shall cause every document,
1326 physical or electronic, in its custody, possession, or control to be restricted."

1358 that the defendant shall not be charged a fee by the Georgia Crime Information Center
1359 for a report produced for purposes of this Code section; and"
1360 "(b) When a petition provided for under subsection (a) of this Code section is filed, it shall
1361 be filed under seal. The clerk of court shall accept defendant's filing under seal without
