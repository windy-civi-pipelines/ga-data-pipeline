25 LC 49 2185

152 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.'"
153 SECTION 1-3.

161 within the meaning of such chapter shall not be required, but the applicant or licensee shall
162 be allowed to appear before the board if he or she so requests. A board may resolve a

166 SECTION 1-4.
167 Said title is further amended in Code Section 43-1-19, relating to a professional licensing
168 board's authority to refuse, grant, revoke, and reinstate licenses, surrender of licenses, and
169 probationary licenses, by revising subsection (q) as follows:
170 "(q)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of this Code section or
171 any other provision of law, and unless the professional licensing board shall refuse to
172 grant a license to an individual or shall revoke a license only if a felony or crime
173 involving moral turpitude covered misdemeanor directly relates to the occupation for
S. B. 207
- 7 -
25 LC 49 2185
174 which the license is sought or held and granting the license would pose a direct and
175 substantial risk to public safety because the individual has not been rehabilitated to safely
176 perform the duties and responsibilities of such occupation, after considering the criteria
177 in paragraph (2) of this subsection. Without finding a direct and substantial risk to public
178 safety and a direct relationship between the conviction and the licensed occupation, no
179 professional licensing board shall refuse to grant a license to an applicant therefor or shall
180 revoke the license of an individual licensed by that board due solely or in part to such
181 applicant's or licensee's:
182 (A) Conviction of any felony or any crime involving moral turpitude covered
183 misdemeanor, whether it occurred in the courts of this state or any other state, territory,
184 or country or in the courts of the United States;

189 16-13-2;
190 (E) Sentence for such offense as a result of a plea of nolo contendere;
191 (F) Adjudication of guilt or sentence was otherwise withheld or not entered; or
192 (G) Being under supervision by a community supervision officer, as such term is
193 defined in Code Section 42-3-1, for a conviction of any felony or any crime involving
194 moral turpitude covered misdemeanor, whether it occurred in the courts of this state or
195 any other state, territory, or country or in the courts of the United States, so long as such
196 individual was not convicted of a felony violation of Chapter 5 of Title 16 nor
197 convicted of a crime requiring registration on the state sexual offender registry.
198 (2) In determining if a felony or crime involving moral turpitude covered misdemeanor
199 directly relates to the occupation for which the license is sought or held, the professional
200 licensing board shall consider:
S. B. 207
- 8 -
25 LC 49 2185
201 (A) The nature and seriousness of such felony or crime involving moral turpitude

25 LC 49 2185
255 (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no professional licensing board may
256 apply a vague character standard to licensure decisions or predeterminations, including,
257 but not limited to, 'good moral character,' 'moral turpitude,' or 'character and fitness.'
258 (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a professional licensing board shall
259 provide individualized consideration of an individual's criminal record and shall not
260 automatically deny licensure on the basis of the individual's criminal record.
261 (6)(A) If an applicant's criminal record includes issues that will or may prevent the
262 board from issuing a license to the applicant, the board shall notify the applicant, in
263 writing, of the specific issues in sufficient time for the applicant to provide additional
264 documentation supporting the application before the board's final decision to deny the
265 application. After receiving notice of any potential issue with licensure due to his or
266 her criminal convictions, an applicant shall have 30 days to respond by correcting any
267 inaccuracy in the criminal record or by submitting additional evidence of mitigation or
268 rehabilitation for the board's consideration, or both.
269 (B) For the professional licensing board to deny a license on the basis of the applicant's
270 criminal convictions, the board shall first provide an opportunity for a hearing for such
271 applicant in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative
272 Procedure Act.' The applicant shall have the opportunity at such hearing to present the
273 written or oral testimony of character witnesses, including, but not limited to, family
274 members, friends, prospective employers, probation or parole officers, and
275 rehabilitation counselors. The professional licensing board shall issue a decision within
276 60 days of the complete submission of the issues for consideration or the hearing,
277 whichever is later.
278 (C) The professional licensing board shall have the burden of justifying, after a
279 hearing, that it is substantially more likely than not that an applicant's criminal record
280 supports any adverse licensing decision. If the board denies an applicant a license by
281 reason of the applicant's criminal record, the board shall:
S. B. 207
- 11 -
25 LC 49 2185
282 (i) Make written findings specifying any of the applicant's convictions and the factors
283 provided for in paragraph (2) of this subsection the board deemed directly relevant
284 and explaining the basis and rationale for the denial. Such written findings shall be
285 signed by the board's presiding officer and shall note the applicant's right to appeal
286 and explain the applicant's ability to reapply. No applicant shall be restricted from
287 reapplying for licensure for more than two years from the date of the most recent
288 application;
289 (ii) Provide or serve a signed copy of the written findings to the applicant within 60
290 days of the denial; and
291 (iii) Retain a signed copy of the written findings for no less than five years.
292 (D) The denial of a license in part or in whole because of the applicant's criminal
293 record shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an
294 administrative hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a license, the professional
295 licensing board shall have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal record
296 directly relates to the occupation for which the license is sought.
297 (7)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual with a criminal
298 record may petition a professional licensing board at any time, including while
299 incarcerated and before starting or completing any required professional qualifications
300 for licensure, for a predetermination as to whether such individual's criminal record will
301 disqualify him or her from obtaining a license.
302 (B) The petition for predetermination shall include the individual's criminal record or
303 authorize the board to obtain the individual's criminal record. The petitioning
304 individual need not disclose any offenses provided for in paragraph (3) of this
305 subsection. Such petition shall also include any information the petitioner chooses to
306 submit concerning the circumstances of his or her record and his or her rehabilitation.
307 (C) In considering predetermination petitions, the professional licensing board shall
308 apply the direct relationship standard in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection and
S. B. 207
- 12 -
25 LC 49 2185
309 shall not consider any offenses falling under paragraph (3) of this subsection. The
310 board shall support any adverse predetermination by justifying that it is substantially
311 more likely than not that a criminal record supports an adverse licensing decision.
312 (D) A predetermination made under this paragraph that a petitioner is eligible for a
313 license shall be binding on the professional licensing board only if the petitioner applies
314 for licensure and fulfills all other requirements for the occupational license and the
315 petitioner's submitted criminal record was correct and remains unchanged at the time
316 of his or her application for a license.
317 (E) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner
318 from licensure, the board shall notify the petitioner of the potentially disqualifying
319 convictions. The letter of concern shall advise the petitioner of his or her opportunity
320 to submit additional evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation or for a hearing, or both.
321 (F) The professional licensing board may predetermine that the petitioner's criminal
322 record is likely grounds for denial of a license only after the board has held a hearing
323 on the petitioner's eligibility in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
324 Administrative Procedure Act.' The hearing shall be held in person, by remote video,
325 or by teleconference within 60 days of receipt of the predetermination petition. The
326 individual shall have the opportunity to offer written or oral testimony of character
327 witnesses at the hearing, including but not limited to family members, friends, past or
328 prospective employers, probation or parole officers, and rehabilitation counselors. The
329 professional licensing board shall not make an adverse inference by a petitioner's
330 decision to forgo a hearing or character witnesses. The board shall issue a final
331 decision within 60 days of complete submission of the issue for consideration or the
332 hearing, whichever is later.
333 (G) If the professional licensing board decides that a predetermination petitioner is
334 ineligible for a license, the board shall notify the petitioner of the following:
S. B. 207
- 13 -
25 LC 49 2185
335 (i) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including any of the
336 petitioner's specific convictions and the factors in paragraph (2) of this subsection the
337 board deemed directly relevant;
338 (ii) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the board's predetermination
339 decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act';
340 and
341 (iii) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An
342 individual who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised
343 petition reflecting completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a
344 new petition to the board not before one year following a final judgment on his or her
345 initial petition or upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.
346 (H) The denial of a predetermination petition because of the applicant's criminal record
347 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an
348 administrative hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination
349 petition, the professional licensing board shall have the burden of proving that the
350 applicant's criminal record directly relates to the licensed occupation.
351 (8) Each professional licensing board shall include in its application for licensure and on
352 its public website all of the following information:
353 (A) Whether the board requires applicants to consent to a criminal record check;
354 (B) The direct relationship standard in paragraph (1) of this subsection and those
355 factors provided for in paragraph (2) of this subsection that the board shall consider
356 when making a determination of licensure;
357 (C) The criminal record disclosure in paragraph (3) of this subsection;
358 (D) The appeals process pursuant to Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
359 Administrative Procedure Act,' if the board denies or revokes licensure in whole or in
360 part because of a criminal conviction; and
S. B. 207
- 14 -

361 (E) The predetermination petition process, standards, and application, as well as the
362 process for appealing an adverse predetermination pursuant to Chapter 13 of Title 50,
363 the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.'
364 (9) No later than March 31 each year, each occupational licensing board shall file with
365 the Secretary of State an annual report containing information from the previous year as
366 to:
367 (A) The number of applicants for a license and, of that number, the number of licenses
368 granted;

499 license shall be binding on the board only if the petitioner applies for licensure and fulfills
500 all other requirements for the licensure and the petitioner's submitted criminal record was
501 correct and remains unchanged at the time of his or her application for a license.
502 (e) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner from
503 licensure, the board shall notify the petitioner of the potentially disqualifying convictions.
504 The letter of concern shall advise the petitioner of his or her opportunity to submit
505 additional evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation or for a hearing, or both.
506 (f) The board may predetermine that the petitioner's criminal record is likely grounds for
507 denial of a license only after the board has held a hearing on the petitioner's eligibility in
508 accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.' The
509 hearing shall be held in person, by remote video, or by teleconference within 60 days of
S. B. 207

510 receipt of the predetermination petition. The individual shall have the opportunity to
511 include character witnesses at the hearing, including but not limited to family members,
512 friends, past or prospective employers, probation or parole officers, and rehabilitation
513 counselors, who may offer their verbal or written support. The board shall not make an
514 adverse inference by a petitioner's decision to forgo a hearing or character witnesses. The
515 board shall issue a final decision within 60 days of complete submission of the issue for
516 consideration or the hearing, whichever is later.
517 (g) If the board decides that a predetermination petitioner is ineligible for a license, the
518 board shall notify the petitioner of the following:
519 (1) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including the specific
520 convictions and the factors in subsection (a) of Code Section 43-15-19.1 the board
521 deemed directly relevant;
522 (2) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the board's predetermination
523 decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act'; and
524 (3) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An individual
525 who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised petition reflecting
526 completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a new petition to the
527 board not before one year following a final judgment on his or her initial petition or upon
528 completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.
529 (h) The denial of a predetermination petition because of the applicant's criminal record
530 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an administrative
531 hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination petition, the board shall
532 have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal record directly relates to the
533 licensed occupation."

853 completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a new petition to the
854 board not before one year following a final judgment on his or her initial petition or
855 upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.

857 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an administrative

1206 or held and granting the license would pose a direct and substantial risk to public safety
1207 because the individual has not been rehabilitated to safely perform the duties and
1208 responsibilities of the practice of medicine. In determining if a criminal record directly
1209 relates to the occupation for which the license is sought or held, the board shall consider:

1247 the date of the board's consideration, except for a felony conviction related to:
1248 (A) A criminal sexual act;
1249 (B) Criminal fraud or embezzlement;

S. B. 207
- 49 -
25 LC 49 2185
1259 completing any required professional qualifications for licensure, for a predetermination
1260 as to whether the individual's criminal record will disqualify him or her from obtaining
1261 a license.
1262 (2) The petition for predetermination shall include the individual's criminal record or
1263 authorize the board to obtain the individual's criminal record. The petitioning individual
1264 need not disclose any offenses falling under paragraph (6) of subsection (a.2) of this Code
1265 section. The petition shall also include any information the petitioner chooses to submit
1266 concerning the circumstances of his or her record and his or her rehabilitation.
1267 (3) In considering predetermination petitions, the board shall apply the direct relationship
1268 standard in subsection (a.1) of this Code section and shall not consider any offenses
1269 falling under paragraph (6) of subsection (a.2) of this Code section. The board shall
1270 support any adverse predetermination by justifying that it is substantially more likely than
1271 not that a criminal record supports an adverse licensing decision.
1272 (4) A predetermination made under this subsection that a petitioner is eligible for a
1273 license shall be binding on the board only if the petitioner applies for licensure and
1274 fulfills all other requirements for the occupational license and the petitioner's submitted
1275 criminal record was correct and remains unchanged at the time of his or her application
1276 for a license.
1277 (5) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner
1278 from licensure, the board shall notify the petitioner of the potentially disqualifying
1279 convictions. The letter of concern shall advise the petitioner of his or her opportunity to
1280 submit additional evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation or for a hearing, or both.
1281 (6) The board may predetermine that the petitioner's criminal record is likely grounds for
1282 denial of a license only after the board has held a hearing on the petitioner's eligibility in
1283 accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.' The
1284 hearing shall be held in person, by remote video, or by teleconference within 60 days of
1285 receipt of the predetermination petition. The individual shall have the opportunity to
S. B. 207
- 50 -
25 LC 49 2185
1286 include character witnesses at the hearing, including but not limited to family members,
1287 friends, past or prospective employers, probation or parole officers, and rehabilitation
1288 counselors, who may offer their verbal or written support. The board shall not make an
1289 adverse inference by a petitioner's decision to forgo a hearing or character witnesses. The
1290 board shall issue a final decision within 60 days of complete submission of the issue for
1291 consideration or the hearing, whichever is later.
1292 (7) If the board decides that a predetermination petitioner is ineligible for a license, the
1293 board shall notify the petitioner of the following:
1294 (A) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including any of the
1295 petitioner's specific convictions and the factors provided for in subsection (a.1) of this
1296 Code section the board deemed directly relevant;
1297 (B) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the board's predetermination
1298 decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act'; and
1299 (C) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An individual
1300 who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised petition reflecting
1301 completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a new petition to the
1302 board not before one year following a final judgment on his or her initial petition or
1303 upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.
1304 (8) The denial of a predetermination petition because of the applicant's criminal record
1305 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an administrative
1306 hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination petition, the board shall
1307 have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal record directly relates to the
1308 licensed occupation."

1730 (ii) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the commission's
1731 predetermination decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative
1732 Procedure Act'; and
1733 (iii) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An
1734 individual who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised
1735 petition reflecting completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a
1736 new petition to the commission not before one year following a final judgment on his
1737 or her initial petition or upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.
1738 (H) The denial of a predetermination petition because of the applicant's criminal record
1739 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an
1740 administrative hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination
1741 petition, the commission shall have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal
1742 record directly relates to the licensed occupation."

1845 of the local board of education, of a complaint by a student against an educator alleging a
1846 sexual offense, as provided for in Code Sections 16-6-1 through 16-6-17 or Code Section
1847 16-6-20, 16-6-22.2, or 16-12-100.

1849 may petition the commission at any time, including while incarcerated and before starting
1850 or completing any required professional qualifications for certification, for a
1851 predetermination as to whether the individual's criminal record will disqualify him or her
1852 from obtaining a certificate.
1853 (2) The petition for predetermination shall include the individual's criminal record or
1854 authorize the commission to obtain the individual's criminal record. The petitioning
1855 individual need not disclose any offenses falling under subsection (c.1) of this Code

1857 concerning the circumstances of his or her record and his or her rehabilitation.
1858 (3) In considering predetermination petitions, the commission shall apply the direct
1859 relationship standard in subsection (a.1) of Code Section 20-2-984.5 and shall not
1860 consider any offenses falling under subsection (c.1) of this Code section. The
1861 commission shall support any adverse predetermination by justifying that it is
1862 substantially more likely than not that a criminal record supports an adverse certification
1863 decision.
1864 (4) A predetermination made under this subsection that a petitioner is eligible for a
1865 certificate shall be binding on the commission only if the petitioner applies for
1866 certification and fulfills all other requirements for the certificate and the petitioner's
1867 submitted criminal record was correct and remains unchanged at the time of his or her
1868 application for a certificate.
1869 (5) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner
1870 from certification, the commission shall notify the petitioner of the potentially
1871 disqualifying convictions. The letter of concern shall advise the petitioner of his or her
1872 opportunity to submit additional evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation or for a
1873 hearing, or both.
1874 (6) The commission may predetermine that the petitioner's criminal record is likely
1875 grounds for denial of a license only after the commission has held a hearing on the
1876 petitioner's eligibility in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
1877 Administrative Procedure Act.' The hearing shall be held in person, by remote video, or
1878 by teleconference within 60 days of receipt of the predetermination petition. The
1879 individual shall have the opportunity to include character witnesses at the hearing,
1880 including but not limited to family members, friends, past or prospective employers,
1881 probation or parole officers, and rehabilitation counselors, who may offer their verbal or
1882 written support. The commission shall not make an adverse inference by a petitioner's
S. B. 207
- 73 -
25 LC 49 2185
1883 decision to forgo a hearing or character witnesses. The commission shall issue a final
1884 decision within 60 days of complete submission of the issue for consideration or the
1885 hearing, whichever is later.
1886 (7) If the commission decides that a predetermination petitioner is ineligible for a
1887 certificate, the commission shall notify the petitioner of the following:
1888 (A) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including any specific
1889 convictions and the factors in subsection (a.1) of Code Section 20-2-984.5 the
1890 commission deemed directly relevant;
1891 (B) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the commission's
1892 predetermination decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative
1893 Procedure Act'; and
1894 (C) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An individual
1895 who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised petition reflecting
1896 completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a new petition to the
1897 commission not before one year following a final judgment on his or her initial petition
1898 or upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.
1899 (8) The denial of a predetermination petition because of the applicant's criminal record
1900 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an administrative
1901 hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination petition, the
1902 commission shall have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal record directly
1903 relates to the licensed occupation."

2075 license shall be binding on the board only if the petitioner applies for licensure and fulfills

2223 "33-23-43.11.
2224 Notwithstanding Code Section 33-23-43.10, the Commissioner shall refuse to grant a
2225 license to an individual or shall revoke a license on the basis of a criminal record only if
2226 said criminal record directly relates to the occupation for which the license is sought or
2227 held and granting the license would pose a direct and substantial risk to public safety
2228 because the individual has not been rehabilitated to safely perform the duties and
2229 responsibilities of a licensee. In determining if a criminal record directly relates to the
2230 occupation for which the license is sought or held, the Commissioner shall consider:
2231 (1) The nature and seriousness of the offense and the direct relationship of the criminal
2232 conduct to the duties and responsibilities of the occupation for which the license is sought
2233 or held;
2234 (2) The age of the individual at the time the offense was committed;

2239 for which the license is sought or held, including, but not limited to:
2240 (A) The completion of the criminal sentence;
2241 (B) A program and treatment certificate issued by the Board of Corrections;
2242 (C) Completion of, or active participation in, a rehabilitative drug or alcohol treatment
2243 program;
2244 (D) Testimonials and recommendations, which may include a progress report from the
2245 individual's probation or parole officer;
2246 (E) Education and training;

2248 (G) Employment aspirations;
2249 (H) The individual's current family or community responsibilities, or both;
2250 (I) Whether a bond is required to practice the occupation;
2251 (J) Any affidavits or other written documents, including, but not limited to, character
2252 references; and
2253 (K) Any other information regarding rehabilitation the individual submits to the

2255 33-23-43.12.

2257 petition the Commissioner at any time, including while incarcerated and before starting or
2258 completing any required professional qualifications for licensure, for a predetermination
2259 as to whether the individual's criminal record will disqualify him or her from obtaining a
2260 public adjuster's license.

2271 license.
2272 (e) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner from
2273 licensure, the Commissioner shall provide notice and opportunity for a hearing in
2274 accordance with Chapter 2 of this title.
2275 (f) If, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the Commissioner decides that a
2276 predetermination petitioner is ineligible for a license, the Commissioner shall notify the

2294 42 and successfully completed the terms of his or her sentence pursuant to Article 3 of
2295 Chapter 8 of Title 42 may, at the council's discretion, be certified and employed as a
2296 firefighter if such person otherwise meets the qualifications set forth in this Code section.
2297 Such person shall provide information on the circumstances underlying the plea of guilty,
2298 as requested by the council, to enable the council to make an informed decision on such
2299 individual's qualification status."
2300 PART VIII

2312 "(xvi) Any offense related to minors generally in violation of Part 2 of Article 3 of
2313 Chapter 12 of Title 16; or
2314 (xvii) Theft in violation of Chapter 8 of Title 16; provided, however, that such
2315 prohibition shall not apply to a misdemeanor conviction of shoplifting or refund fraud
2316 in violation of Code Section 16-8-14 or 16-8-14.1, as applicable; or
2317 (xviii) Any serious traffic offense in violation of Article 15 of Chapter 6 of Title 40.
2318 (C) An individual shall be limited to filing a petition under this paragraph to a lifetime
2319 maximum of requesting record restriction on two convictions for a misdemeanor or a
2320 series of misdemeanors arising from a single incident. For the purposes of this
2321 subparagraph, the conviction of two or more offenses charged in separate counts of one
2322 or more accusations consolidated for trial shall be deemed to be one conviction. If a
2323 petition under this subsection has been denied, an individual may file a subsequent
2324 petition on the same conviction for a misdemeanor or series of misdemeanors arising
2325 from a single incident after the expiration of two years from the date of the final order
2326 from the previous petition."
2327 "(E) When the petition provided for under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is filed,
2328 it shall be filed under seal. The clerk of court shall accept a defendant's filing under
2329 seal without need of a court order for any petition provided for under subparagraph (A)

2334 individual has been granted a pardon from the State Board of Pardons and Paroles as
2335 provided in the Constitution and Code Section 42-9-42, provided that the offense was not
2336 a serious violent felony as such term is defined in Code Section 17-10-6.1 or a sexual
S. B. 207
- 91 -
25 LC 49 2185
2337 offense as such term is defined in Code Section 17-10-6.2, and provided, further, that
2338 such individual has not been convicted of any crime in any jurisdiction, excluding any
2339 conviction for a nonserious traffic offense, since the pardon was granted, and provided,
2340 further, that he or she has no pending charged offenses, he or she may petition the court
2341 in which the conviction occurred to restrict access to criminal history record information.
2342 Such court shall maintain jurisdiction over the case for this limited purpose and duration.
2343 Such petition shall be served on the prosecuting attorney. If a hearing is requested, such
2344 hearing shall be held within 90 days of the filing of the petition. If the court finds that the
2345 criteria for such petition are met, the court shall grant an order restricting such criminal
2346 history record information. The court shall hear evidence and shall grant an order
2347 restricting such criminal history record information if it determines that the harm
2348 otherwise resulting to the individual clearly outweighs the public's interest in the criminal
2349 history record information being publicly available."
2350 "(k)(1) Upon an approved restriction, by order or application, pursuant to this Code
2351 section, the prosecuting attorney of the relevant case shall, within 30 days, restrict access

2355 individual who has a record restricted pursuant to Code Section 17-10-21 or this Code
2356 section or an individual who has been cited for a criminal offense but was not arrested
2357 and the charged offense was subsequently dismissed, nolle prossed, or adjudicated as a
2358 violation of a local ordinance may petition the court with original jurisdiction over the
2359 offenses in the county where the clerk of court is located for an order to seal all criminal
2360 history record information maintained by the clerk of court for such individual's charged
2361 offense. Notice of such petition shall be sent to the clerk of court and the prosecuting
2362 attorney. A notice sent by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery shall
2363 be sufficient notice.
S. B. 207
- 92 -

2364 (2) The court shall order all criminal history record information in the custody of the
2365 clerk of court, including within any index, to be restricted and unavailable to the public
2366 if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:
2367 (A) The criminal history record information has been restricted pursuant to this Code
2368 section; and
2369 (B) The harm otherwise resulting to the privacy of the individual clearly outweighs the
2370 public interest in the criminal history record information being publicly available.
2371 (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, the court shall order all criminal
2372 history record information in the custody of the clerk of court, including within any

2374 restricted pursuant to paragraph (7) of subsection (j) of this Code section.
2375 (4) Within 60 days of the court's order, the clerk of court shall cause every document,
2376 physical or electronic, in its custody, possession, or control to be restricted."

2383 (D) By a prosecuting attorney or a public defender;
2384 (E) Pursuant to a court order; and
2385 (F) By an individual who is the subject of restricted criminal history record information
2386 or sealed court files; and
2387 (G) By criminal justice agencies for law enforcement or criminal investigative

2409 for a report produced for purposes of this Code section; and"
2410 "(b) When a petition provided for under subsection (a) of this Code section is filed, it shall
2411 be filed under seal. The clerk of court shall accept defendant's filing under seal without

152 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.'"
153 SECTION 1-3.

161 within the meaning of such chapter shall not be required, but the applicant or licensee shall
162 be allowed to appear before the board if he or she so requests. A board may resolve a

165 disclosed to any person except the licensee or applicant."
166 SECTION 1-4.
167 Said title is further amended in Code Section 43-1-19, relating to a professional licensing
168 board's authority to refuse, grant, revoke, and reinstate licenses, surrender of licenses, and
169 probationary licenses, by revising subsection (q) as follows:
170 "(q)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of this Code section or
171 any other provision of law, and unless the professional licensing board shall refuse to
172 grant a license to an individual or shall revoke a license only if a felony or crime
173 involving moral turpitude covered misdemeanor directly relates to the occupation for
S. B. 207
- 7 -

25 LC 49 2185
174 which the license is sought or held and granting the license would pose a direct and
175 substantial risk to public safety because the individual has not been rehabilitated to safely
176 perform the duties and responsibilities of such occupation, after considering the criteria
177 in paragraph (2) of this subsection. Without finding a direct and substantial risk to public
178 safety and a direct relationship between the conviction and the licensed occupation, no
179 professional licensing board shall refuse to grant a license to an applicant therefor or shall
180 revoke the license of an individual licensed by that board due solely or in part to such
181 applicant's or licensee's:
182 (A) Conviction of any felony or any crime involving moral turpitude covered
183 misdemeanor, whether it occurred in the courts of this state or any other state, territory,
184 or country or in the courts of the United States;
185 (B) Arrest, charge, and sentence for the commission of such offense;

188 (D) Sentence for such offense pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) of Code Section
189 16-13-2;
190 (E) Sentence for such offense as a result of a plea of nolo contendere;
191 (F) Adjudication of guilt or sentence was otherwise withheld or not entered; or
192 (G) Being under supervision by a community supervision officer, as such term is
193 defined in Code Section 42-3-1, for a conviction of any felony or any crime involving
194 moral turpitude covered misdemeanor, whether it occurred in the courts of this state or
195 any other state, territory, or country or in the courts of the United States, so long as such
196 individual was not convicted of a felony violation of Chapter 5 of Title 16 nor
197 convicted of a crime requiring registration on the state sexual offender registry.
198 (2) In determining if a felony or crime involving moral turpitude covered misdemeanor
199 directly relates to the occupation for which the license is sought or held, the professional
200 licensing board shall consider:
S. B. 207
- 8 -

25 LC 49 2185
201 (A) The nature and seriousness of such felony or crime involving moral turpitude

218 treatment program;
219 (iv) Testimonials and recommendations, which may include a progress report from
220 the individual's probation or parole officer;
221 (v) Education and training;
222 (vi) Employment history;
223 (vii) Employment aspirations;
224 (viii) The individual's current family or community responsibilities, or both;

228 (xi) Any other information regarding rehabilitation the individual submits to the
229 board.

244 or a conviction for which the individual's incarceration ended more than five years

247 (ii) Criminal fraud or embezzlement;
248 (iii) Aggravated assault;

25 LC 49 2185
255 (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no professional licensing board may
256 apply a vague character standard to licensure decisions or predeterminations, including,
257 but not limited to, 'good moral character,' 'moral turpitude,' or 'character and fitness.'
258 (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a professional licensing board shall
259 provide individualized consideration of an individual's criminal record and shall not
260 automatically deny licensure on the basis of the individual's criminal record.
261 (6)(A) If an applicant's criminal record includes issues that will or may prevent the
262 board from issuing a license to the applicant, the board shall notify the applicant, in
263 writing, of the specific issues in sufficient time for the applicant to provide additional
264 documentation supporting the application before the board's final decision to deny the
265 application. After receiving notice of any potential issue with licensure due to his or
266 her criminal convictions, an applicant shall have 30 days to respond by correcting any
267 inaccuracy in the criminal record or by submitting additional evidence of mitigation or
268 rehabilitation for the board's consideration, or both.
269 (B) For the professional licensing board to deny a license on the basis of the applicant's
270 criminal convictions, the board shall first provide an opportunity for a hearing for such
271 applicant in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative
272 Procedure Act.' The applicant shall have the opportunity at such hearing to present the
273 written or oral testimony of character witnesses, including, but not limited to, family
274 members, friends, prospective employers, probation or parole officers, and
275 rehabilitation counselors. The professional licensing board shall issue a decision within
276 60 days of the complete submission of the issues for consideration or the hearing,
277 whichever is later.
278 (C) The professional licensing board shall have the burden of justifying, after a
279 hearing, that it is substantially more likely than not that an applicant's criminal record
280 supports any adverse licensing decision. If the board denies an applicant a license by
281 reason of the applicant's criminal record, the board shall:
S. B. 207
- 11 -

25 LC 49 2185
282 (i) Make written findings specifying any of the applicant's convictions and the factors
283 provided for in paragraph (2) of this subsection the board deemed directly relevant
284 and explaining the basis and rationale for the denial. Such written findings shall be
285 signed by the board's presiding officer and shall note the applicant's right to appeal
286 and explain the applicant's ability to reapply. No applicant shall be restricted from
287 reapplying for licensure for more than two years from the date of the most recent
288 application;
289 (ii) Provide or serve a signed copy of the written findings to the applicant within 60
290 days of the denial; and
291 (iii) Retain a signed copy of the written findings for no less than five years.
292 (D) The denial of a license in part or in whole because of the applicant's criminal
293 record shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an
294 administrative hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a license, the professional
295 licensing board shall have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal record
296 directly relates to the occupation for which the license is sought.
297 (7)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual with a criminal
298 record may petition a professional licensing board at any time, including while
299 incarcerated and before starting or completing any required professional qualifications
300 for licensure, for a predetermination as to whether such individual's criminal record will
301 disqualify him or her from obtaining a license.
302 (B) The petition for predetermination shall include the individual's criminal record or
303 authorize the board to obtain the individual's criminal record. The petitioning
304 individual need not disclose any offenses provided for in paragraph (3) of this
305 subsection. Such petition shall also include any information the petitioner chooses to
306 submit concerning the circumstances of his or her record and his or her rehabilitation.
307 (C) In considering predetermination petitions, the professional licensing board shall
308 apply the direct relationship standard in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection and
S. B. 207
- 12 -

25 LC 49 2185
309 shall not consider any offenses falling under paragraph (3) of this subsection. The
310 board shall support any adverse predetermination by justifying that it is substantially
311 more likely than not that a criminal record supports an adverse licensing decision.
312 (D) A predetermination made under this paragraph that a petitioner is eligible for a
313 license shall be binding on the professional licensing board only if the petitioner applies
314 for licensure and fulfills all other requirements for the occupational license and the
315 petitioner's submitted criminal record was correct and remains unchanged at the time
316 of his or her application for a license.
317 (E) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner
318 from licensure, the board shall notify the petitioner of the potentially disqualifying
319 convictions. The letter of concern shall advise the petitioner of his or her opportunity
320 to submit additional evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation or for a hearing, or both.
321 (F) The professional licensing board may predetermine that the petitioner's criminal
322 record is likely grounds for denial of a license only after the board has held a hearing
323 on the petitioner's eligibility in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
324 Administrative Procedure Act.' The hearing shall be held in person, by remote video,
325 or by teleconference within 60 days of receipt of the predetermination petition. The
326 individual shall have the opportunity to offer written or oral testimony of character
327 witnesses at the hearing, including but not limited to family members, friends, past or
328 prospective employers, probation or parole officers, and rehabilitation counselors. The
329 professional licensing board shall not make an adverse inference by a petitioner's
330 decision to forgo a hearing or character witnesses. The board shall issue a final
331 decision within 60 days of complete submission of the issue for consideration or the
332 hearing, whichever is later.
333 (G) If the professional licensing board decides that a predetermination petitioner is
334 ineligible for a license, the board shall notify the petitioner of the following:
S. B. 207
- 13 -

25 LC 49 2185
335 (i) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including any of the
336 petitioner's specific convictions and the factors in paragraph (2) of this subsection the
337 board deemed directly relevant;
338 (ii) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the board's predetermination
339 decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act';
340 and
341 (iii) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An
342 individual who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised
343 petition reflecting completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a
344 new petition to the board not before one year following a final judgment on his or her
345 initial petition or upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.
346 (H) The denial of a predetermination petition because of the applicant's criminal record
347 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an
348 administrative hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination
349 petition, the professional licensing board shall have the burden of proving that the
350 applicant's criminal record directly relates to the licensed occupation.
351 (8) Each professional licensing board shall include in its application for licensure and on
352 its public website all of the following information:
353 (A) Whether the board requires applicants to consent to a criminal record check;
354 (B) The direct relationship standard in paragraph (1) of this subsection and those
355 factors provided for in paragraph (2) of this subsection that the board shall consider
356 when making a determination of licensure;
357 (C) The criminal record disclosure in paragraph (3) of this subsection;
358 (D) The appeals process pursuant to Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
359 Administrative Procedure Act,' if the board denies or revokes licensure in whole or in
360 part because of a criminal conviction; and
S. B. 207
- 14 -

25 LC 49 2185
361 (E) The predetermination petition process, standards, and application, as well as the
362 process for appealing an adverse predetermination pursuant to Chapter 13 of Title 50,
363 the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.'
364 (9) No later than March 31 each year, each occupational licensing board shall file with
365 the Secretary of State an annual report containing information from the previous year as
366 to:
367 (A) The number of applicants for a license and, of that number, the number of licenses
368 granted;
369 (B) The number of applicants with a criminal record and, of that number, the number
370 of licenses granted, denied a license for any reason, and denied a license due to a
371 conviction or state supervision status;
372 (C) The number of predetermination petitioners and, of that number, the number
373 deemed eligible for a license and the number deemed ineligible for a license;
374 (D) The racial and ethnic distribution of licensing applicants, including the racial and
375 ethnic distribution of applicants with a criminal record; and
376 (E) The racial and ethnic distribution of licensing applicants with a criminal record
377 granted a license, denied a license for any reason, and denied a license due to a
378 conviction or state supervision status."

484 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual with a criminal record may
485 petition the board at any time, including while incarcerated and before starting or

487 as to whether the individual's criminal record will disqualify him or her from obtaining a
488 license.
489 (b) The petition for predetermination shall include the individual's criminal record or
490 authorize the board to obtain the individual's criminal record. The petitioning individual
491 need not disclose any offenses falling under subsection (b) of Code Section 43-15-19.1.
492 The petition shall also include any information the petitioner chooses to submit concerning
493 the circumstances of his or her record and his or her rehabilitation.
494 (c) In considering predetermination petitions, the board shall apply the direct relationship
495 standard in subsection (a) of Code Section 43-15-19.1. The board shall support any
496 adverse predetermination by justifying that it is substantially more likely than not that a
497 criminal record supports an adverse licensing decision.
498 (d) A predetermination made under this Code section that a petitioner is eligible for a
499 license shall be binding on the board only if the petitioner applies for licensure and fulfills
500 all other requirements for the licensure and the petitioner's submitted criminal record was
501 correct and remains unchanged at the time of his or her application for a license.
502 (e) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner from
503 licensure, the board shall notify the petitioner of the potentially disqualifying convictions.
504 The letter of concern shall advise the petitioner of his or her opportunity to submit
505 additional evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation or for a hearing, or both.
506 (f) The board may predetermine that the petitioner's criminal record is likely grounds for
507 denial of a license only after the board has held a hearing on the petitioner's eligibility in
508 accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.' The
509 hearing shall be held in person, by remote video, or by teleconference within 60 days of
S. B. 207

510 receipt of the predetermination petition. The individual shall have the opportunity to
511 include character witnesses at the hearing, including but not limited to family members,
512 friends, past or prospective employers, probation or parole officers, and rehabilitation
513 counselors, who may offer their verbal or written support. The board shall not make an
514 adverse inference by a petitioner's decision to forgo a hearing or character witnesses. The
515 board shall issue a final decision within 60 days of complete submission of the issue for
516 consideration or the hearing, whichever is later.
517 (g) If the board decides that a predetermination petitioner is ineligible for a license, the
518 board shall notify the petitioner of the following:
519 (1) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including the specific
520 convictions and the factors in subsection (a) of Code Section 43-15-19.1 the board
521 deemed directly relevant;
522 (2) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the board's predetermination
523 decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act'; and
524 (3) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An individual
525 who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised petition reflecting
526 completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a new petition to the
527 board not before one year following a final judgment on his or her initial petition or upon
528 completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.
529 (h) The denial of a predetermination petition because of the applicant's criminal record
530 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an administrative
531 hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination petition, the board shall
532 have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal record directly relates to the
533 licensed occupation."

1205 only if a criminal record directly relates to the occupation for which the license is sought
1206 or held and granting the license would pose a direct and substantial risk to public safety
1207 because the individual has not been rehabilitated to safely perform the duties and
1208 responsibilities of the practice of medicine. In determining if a criminal record directly
1209 relates to the occupation for which the license is sought or held, the board shall consider:
1210 (1) The nature and seriousness of the offense and the direct relationship of the criminal

1248 (A) A criminal sexual act;
1249 (B) Criminal fraud or embezzlement;

- 49 -

25 LC 49 2185
1259 completing any required professional qualifications for licensure, for a predetermination
1260 as to whether the individual's criminal record will disqualify him or her from obtaining
1261 a license.
1262 (2) The petition for predetermination shall include the individual's criminal record or
1263 authorize the board to obtain the individual's criminal record. The petitioning individual
1264 need not disclose any offenses falling under paragraph (6) of subsection (a.2) of this Code
1265 section. The petition shall also include any information the petitioner chooses to submit
1266 concerning the circumstances of his or her record and his or her rehabilitation.
1267 (3) In considering predetermination petitions, the board shall apply the direct relationship
1268 standard in subsection (a.1) of this Code section and shall not consider any offenses
1269 falling under paragraph (6) of subsection (a.2) of this Code section. The board shall
1270 support any adverse predetermination by justifying that it is substantially more likely than
1271 not that a criminal record supports an adverse licensing decision.
1272 (4) A predetermination made under this subsection that a petitioner is eligible for a
1273 license shall be binding on the board only if the petitioner applies for licensure and
1274 fulfills all other requirements for the occupational license and the petitioner's submitted
1275 criminal record was correct and remains unchanged at the time of his or her application
1276 for a license.
1277 (5) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner
1278 from licensure, the board shall notify the petitioner of the potentially disqualifying
1279 convictions. The letter of concern shall advise the petitioner of his or her opportunity to
1280 submit additional evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation or for a hearing, or both.
1281 (6) The board may predetermine that the petitioner's criminal record is likely grounds for
1282 denial of a license only after the board has held a hearing on the petitioner's eligibility in
1283 accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.' The
1284 hearing shall be held in person, by remote video, or by teleconference within 60 days of
1285 receipt of the predetermination petition. The individual shall have the opportunity to
S. B. 207
- 50 -

25 LC 49 2185
1286 include character witnesses at the hearing, including but not limited to family members,
1287 friends, past or prospective employers, probation or parole officers, and rehabilitation
1288 counselors, who may offer their verbal or written support. The board shall not make an
1289 adverse inference by a petitioner's decision to forgo a hearing or character witnesses. The
1290 board shall issue a final decision within 60 days of complete submission of the issue for
1291 consideration or the hearing, whichever is later.
1292 (7) If the board decides that a predetermination petitioner is ineligible for a license, the
1293 board shall notify the petitioner of the following:
1294 (A) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including any of the
1295 petitioner's specific convictions and the factors provided for in subsection (a.1) of this
1296 Code section the board deemed directly relevant;
1297 (B) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the board's predetermination
1298 decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act'; and
1299 (C) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An individual
1300 who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised petition reflecting
1301 completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a new petition to the
1302 board not before one year following a final judgment on his or her initial petition or
1303 upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.
1304 (8) The denial of a predetermination petition because of the applicant's criminal record
1305 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an administrative
1306 hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination petition, the board shall
1307 have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal record directly relates to the
1308 licensed occupation."

1730 (ii) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the commission's
1731 predetermination decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative

1733 (iii) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An
1734 individual who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised
1735 petition reflecting completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a
1736 new petition to the commission not before one year following a final judgment on his
1737 or her initial petition or upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.

1739 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an
1740 administrative hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination
1741 petition, the commission shall have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal
1742 record directly relates to the licensed occupation."

1842 (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of this Code section, the staff of the commission
1843 shall be authorized, without notification to the commission, to immediately open an
1844 investigation submitted to the commission by a local school superintendent, with approval
1845 of the local board of education, of a complaint by a student against an educator alleging a
1846 sexual offense, as provided for in Code Sections 16-6-1 through 16-6-17 or Code Section
1847 16-6-20, 16-6-22.2, or 16-12-100.
1848 (e)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual with a criminal record
1849 may petition the commission at any time, including while incarcerated and before starting
1850 or completing any required professional qualifications for certification, for a
1851 predetermination as to whether the individual's criminal record will disqualify him or her
1852 from obtaining a certificate.
1853 (2) The petition for predetermination shall include the individual's criminal record or
1854 authorize the commission to obtain the individual's criminal record. The petitioning
1855 individual need not disclose any offenses falling under subsection (c.1) of this Code

1857 concerning the circumstances of his or her record and his or her rehabilitation.
1858 (3) In considering predetermination petitions, the commission shall apply the direct
1859 relationship standard in subsection (a.1) of Code Section 20-2-984.5 and shall not
1860 consider any offenses falling under subsection (c.1) of this Code section. The
1861 commission shall support any adverse predetermination by justifying that it is
1862 substantially more likely than not that a criminal record supports an adverse certification
1863 decision.
1864 (4) A predetermination made under this subsection that a petitioner is eligible for a
1865 certificate shall be binding on the commission only if the petitioner applies for
1866 certification and fulfills all other requirements for the certificate and the petitioner's
1867 submitted criminal record was correct and remains unchanged at the time of his or her
1868 application for a certificate.
1869 (5) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner
1870 from certification, the commission shall notify the petitioner of the potentially
1871 disqualifying convictions. The letter of concern shall advise the petitioner of his or her
1872 opportunity to submit additional evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation or for a
1873 hearing, or both.
1874 (6) The commission may predetermine that the petitioner's criminal record is likely
1875 grounds for denial of a license only after the commission has held a hearing on the
1876 petitioner's eligibility in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia
1877 Administrative Procedure Act.' The hearing shall be held in person, by remote video, or
1878 by teleconference within 60 days of receipt of the predetermination petition. The
1879 individual shall have the opportunity to include character witnesses at the hearing,
1880 including but not limited to family members, friends, past or prospective employers,
1881 probation or parole officers, and rehabilitation counselors, who may offer their verbal or
1882 written support. The commission shall not make an adverse inference by a petitioner's
S. B. 207
- 73 -

25 LC 49 2185
1883 decision to forgo a hearing or character witnesses. The commission shall issue a final
1884 decision within 60 days of complete submission of the issue for consideration or the
1885 hearing, whichever is later.
1886 (7) If the commission decides that a predetermination petitioner is ineligible for a
1887 certificate, the commission shall notify the petitioner of the following:
1888 (A) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including any specific
1889 convictions and the factors in subsection (a.1) of Code Section 20-2-984.5 the
1890 commission deemed directly relevant;
1891 (B) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the commission's
1892 predetermination decision under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative
1893 Procedure Act'; and
1894 (C) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An individual
1895 who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised petition reflecting
1896 completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a new petition to the
1897 commission not before one year following a final judgment on his or her initial petition
1898 or upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier.
1899 (8) The denial of a predetermination petition because of the applicant's criminal record
1900 shall constitute a contested case as defined in Code Section 50-13-2. In an administrative
1901 hearing or civil action reviewing the denial of a predetermination petition, the
1902 commission shall have the burden of proving that the applicant's criminal record directly
1903 relates to the licensed occupation."
1904 SECTION 3-3.

2209 (f) If, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the Commissioner decides that a
2210 predetermination petitioner is ineligible for a license, the Commissioner shall notify the
2211 petitioner of the following:
2212 (1) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including the factors in Code
2213 Section 33-23-21.2 the Commissioner deemed directly relevant;
2214 (2) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the Commissioner's
2215 predetermination decision; and
2216 (3) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An individual

2220 or upon completing the remedial actions, whichever is earlier."
2221 SECTION 6-3.
2222 Said title is further amended by adding two new Code sections to read as follows:
2223 "33-23-43.11.
2224 Notwithstanding Code Section 33-23-43.10, the Commissioner shall refuse to grant a
2225 license to an individual or shall revoke a license on the basis of a criminal record only if
2226 said criminal record directly relates to the occupation for which the license is sought or
2227 held and granting the license would pose a direct and substantial risk to public safety
2228 because the individual has not been rehabilitated to safely perform the duties and
2229 responsibilities of a licensee. In determining if a criminal record directly relates to the
2230 occupation for which the license is sought or held, the Commissioner shall consider:
2231 (1) The nature and seriousness of the offense and the direct relationship of the criminal
2232 conduct to the duties and responsibilities of the occupation for which the license is sought
2233 or held;
2234 (2) The age of the individual at the time the offense was committed;
S. B. 207

25 LC 49 2185
2235 (3) The length of time elapsed since the offense was committed;
2236 (4) All circumstances relative to the offense, including, but not limited to, mitigating
2237 circumstances or social conditions surrounding the commission of the offense; and
2238 (5) Evidence of rehabilitation and present fitness to perform the duties of the occupation
2239 for which the license is sought or held, including, but not limited to:
2240 (A) The completion of the criminal sentence;
2241 (B) A program and treatment certificate issued by the Board of Corrections;
2242 (C) Completion of, or active participation in, a rehabilitative drug or alcohol treatment
2243 program;
2244 (D) Testimonials and recommendations, which may include a progress report from the
2245 individual's probation or parole officer;
2246 (E) Education and training;
2247 (F) Employment history;
2248 (G) Employment aspirations;
2249 (H) The individual's current family or community responsibilities, or both;
2250 (I) Whether a bond is required to practice the occupation;
2251 (J) Any affidavits or other written documents, including, but not limited to, character
2252 references; and
2253 (K) Any other information regarding rehabilitation the individual submits to the
2254 Commissioner.
2255 33-23-43.12.
2256 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual with a criminal record may
2257 petition the Commissioner at any time, including while incarcerated and before starting or
2258 completing any required professional qualifications for licensure, for a predetermination
2259 as to whether the individual's criminal record will disqualify him or her from obtaining a
2260 public adjuster's license.
S. B. 207

25 LC 49 2185
2261 (b) The petition for predetermination shall include the individual's criminal record or
2262 authorize the Commissioner to obtain the individual's criminal record. The petition shall
2263 also include information submitted by the petitioner concerning the circumstances of his
2264 or her record and his or her rehabilitation.
2265 (c) In considering predetermination petitions, the Commissioner shall apply the direct
2266 relationship standard in Code Section 33-23-43.11.
2267 (d) A predetermination made under this Code section that a petitioner is eligible for a
2268 license shall be binding on the Commissioner only if the petitioner applies for licensure and
2269 fulfills all other requirements for the licensure and the petitioner's submitted criminal
2270 record was correct and remains unchanged at the time of his or her application for a
2271 license.
2272 (e) If a petitioner's criminal record includes matters that may disqualify the petitioner from
2273 licensure, the Commissioner shall provide notice and opportunity for a hearing in
2274 accordance with Chapter 2 of this title.
2275 (f) If, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the Commissioner decides that a
2276 predetermination petitioner is ineligible for a license, the Commissioner shall notify the
2277 petitioner of the following:
2278 (1) The grounds and rationale for the predetermination, including the specific
2279 convictions and the factors in Code Section 33-23-43.11 the Commissioner deemed
2280 directly relevant;
2281 (2) An explanation of the process and right to appeal the Commissioner's
2282 predetermination decision; and
2283 (3) Any actions the petitioner may take to remedy the disqualification. An individual
2284 who receives a predetermination of ineligibility may submit a revised petition reflecting
2285 completion of the remedial actions. The individual may submit a new petition to the
2286 Commissioner not before one year following a final judgment on his or her initial petition

2295 Chapter 8 of Title 42 may, at the council's discretion, be certified and employed as a
2296 firefighter if such person otherwise meets the qualifications set forth in this Code section.
2297 Such person shall provide information on the circumstances underlying the plea of guilty,
2298 as requested by the council, to enable the council to make an informed decision on such
2299 individual's qualification status."
2300 PART VIII

25 LC 49 2185
2310 "(2) 'Entity' means the arresting law enforcement agency, including county and municipal
2311 jails and detention centers, and the Department of Corrections."
2312 "(xvi) Any offense related to minors generally in violation of Part 2 of Article 3 of
2313 Chapter 12 of Title 16; or
2314 (xvii) Theft in violation of Chapter 8 of Title 16; provided, however, that such
2315 prohibition shall not apply to a misdemeanor conviction of shoplifting or refund fraud
2316 in violation of Code Section 16-8-14 or 16-8-14.1, as applicable; or
2317 (xviii) Any serious traffic offense in violation of Article 15 of Chapter 6 of Title 40.
2318 (C) An individual shall be limited to filing a petition under this paragraph to a lifetime
2319 maximum of requesting record restriction on two convictions for a misdemeanor or a
2320 series of misdemeanors arising from a single incident. For the purposes of this
2321 subparagraph, the conviction of two or more offenses charged in separate counts of one
2322 or more accusations consolidated for trial shall be deemed to be one conviction. If a
2323 petition under this subsection has been denied, an individual may file a subsequent
2324 petition on the same conviction for a misdemeanor or series of misdemeanors arising
2325 from a single incident after the expiration of two years from the date of the final order
2326 from the previous petition."
2327 "(E) When the petition provided for under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is filed,
2328 it shall be filed under seal. The clerk of court shall accept a defendant's filing under
2329 seal without need of a court order for any petition provided for under subparagraph (A)
2330 of this paragraph. All subsequent filings, motions, hearings, court recordings, court
2331 transcripts, orders, and related court documents related to such petition shall remain
2332 under seal without need for any additional court order."

2334 individual has been granted a pardon from the State Board of Pardons and Paroles as
2335 provided in the Constitution and Code Section 42-9-42, provided that the offense was not
2336 a serious violent felony as such term is defined in Code Section 17-10-6.1 or a sexual
S. B. 207
- 91 -

25 LC 49 2185
2337 offense as such term is defined in Code Section 17-10-6.2, and provided, further, that
2338 such individual has not been convicted of any crime in any jurisdiction, excluding any
2339 conviction for a nonserious traffic offense, since the pardon was granted, and provided,
2340 further, that he or she has no pending charged offenses, he or she may petition the court
2341 in which the conviction occurred to restrict access to criminal history record information.
2342 Such court shall maintain jurisdiction over the case for this limited purpose and duration.
2343 Such petition shall be served on the prosecuting attorney. If a hearing is requested, such
2344 hearing shall be held within 90 days of the filing of the petition. If the court finds that the
2345 criteria for such petition are met, the court shall grant an order restricting such criminal
2346 history record information. The court shall hear evidence and shall grant an order
2347 restricting such criminal history record information if it determines that the harm
2348 otherwise resulting to the individual clearly outweighs the public's interest in the criminal
2349 history record information being publicly available."
2350 "(k)(1) Upon an approved restriction, by order or application, pursuant to this Code
2351 section, the prosecuting attorney of the relevant case shall, within 30 days, restrict access
2352 to all such information maintained by the prosecuting attorney for such individual's
2353 offense that has been restricted."
2354 "(m)(1) For criminal history record information maintained by the clerk of court, an
2355 individual who has a record restricted pursuant to Code Section 17-10-21 or this Code
2356 section or an individual who has been cited for a criminal offense but was not arrested
2357 and the charged offense was subsequently dismissed, nolle prossed, or adjudicated as a
2358 violation of a local ordinance may petition the court with original jurisdiction over the
2359 offenses in the county where the clerk of court is located for an order to seal all criminal
2360 history record information maintained by the clerk of court for such individual's charged
2361 offense. Notice of such petition shall be sent to the clerk of court and the prosecuting
2362 attorney. A notice sent by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery shall
2363 be sufficient notice.
S. B. 207

2364 (2) The court shall order all criminal history record information in the custody of the
2365 clerk of court, including within any index, to be restricted and unavailable to the public
2366 if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:
2367 (A) The criminal history record information has been restricted pursuant to this Code
2368 section; and
2369 (B) The harm otherwise resulting to the privacy of the individual clearly outweighs the
2370 public interest in the criminal history record information being publicly available.
2371 (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, the court shall order all criminal
2372 history record information in the custody of the clerk of court, including within any
2373 index, to be restricted and unavailable to the public if the criminal history record has been
2374 restricted pursuant to paragraph (7) of subsection (j) of this Code section.
2375 (4) Within 60 days of the court's order, the clerk of court shall cause every document,
2376 physical or electronic, in its custody, possession, or control to be restricted."
2377 "(v)(1) Information restricted and sealed pursuant to this Code section shall always be

2379 (A) For the purpose of imposing a sentence under Article 3 of Chapter 8 of Title 42;
2380 (B) By the Judicial Qualifications Commission;
2381 (C) By an attorney representing an accused individual who submits a sworn affidavit
2382 to the clerk of court attesting that such information is relevant to a criminal proceeding;
2383 (D) By a prosecuting attorney or a public defender;
2384 (E) Pursuant to a court order; and
2385 (F) By an individual who is the subject of restricted criminal history record information
2386 or sealed court files; and
2387 (G) By criminal justice agencies for law enforcement or criminal investigative
2388 purposes.
2389 (2) The confidentiality of such information shall be maintained insofar as practicable."

2409 for a report produced for purposes of this Code section; and"
2410 "(b) When a petition provided for under subsection (a) of this Code section is filed, it shall
2411 be filed under seal. The clerk of court shall accept defendant's filing under seal without
