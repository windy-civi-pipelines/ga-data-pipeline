SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
House Bill (LC 56 0281)
Dear Representative Crowe:
This bill would amend provisions relating to eligibility for retirement benefits for certain law
enforcement personnel covered under the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia. Under current
law, the normal retirement age for most members of the System is 60 years of age. However, the
normal retirement age for certain law enforcement personnel is 55 years of age provided they have at
least 10 years of creditable service.
This legislation expands the list of law enforcement personnel who would be eligible for a normal
retirement benefit at 55 years of age to include all members who are in service with the Department
of Public Safety as a sworn law enforcement officer, noncommissioned officer, or trooper, as well as
the commissioner and the deputy commissioner of the Department of Public Safety. Such members
would also be covered by the creditable service and disability benefits provisions provided to other
law enforcement personnel.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems
Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
