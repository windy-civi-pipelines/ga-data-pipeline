33 and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation bureau to preserve the confidentiality of
34 patients' rights in all other respects. After five years have elapsed from the date that a

44 of such petition, such court shall hold a hearing on such petition; provided, however,

46 prosecuting attorney may represent the interests of the state at such hearing.

75 center immediately, but in no case later than ten days after the date of such order, and
76 the center shall purge such record that is the subject of the order as soon as practicable
77 but not later than 30 days after receipt of such order.

86 obtained in such other case or context by other rules of evidence or discovery."
