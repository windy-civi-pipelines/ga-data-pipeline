14 WHEREAS, Governor Perdue continued his service to our country when President Donald
15 Trump appointed him to serve as Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture,
16 a post he held for four years following his confirmation by the Senate; and
17 WHEREAS, following his tenure as Agriculture Secretary, Perdue was appointed as
18 Chancellor of the University System of Georgia, the post he currently holds; and
19 WHEREAS, due in no small measure to the work, leadership, and achievements of Sonny
20 Perdue, the State of Georgia consequently enjoys a robust business climate and economy that
21 make possible the construction of a new legislative office complex on the grounds of the
22 State Capitol that is worthy of the state's elected leaders and the People they serve; and
23 WHEREAS, it therefore is proper and appropriate to honor Sonny Perdue's lifetime of public
24 service and dedication to the State of Georgia and the United States of America by naming
25 after him the new home and symbol of democracy in this state.
26 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY that the new

28 and known as the "Sonny Perdue Legislative Building."
29 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
