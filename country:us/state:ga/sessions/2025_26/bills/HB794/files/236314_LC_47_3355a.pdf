15 "SECTION 14.1.
16 (a) Purpose.
17 (1) It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the Clayton County
18 government that its officials and employees be, and give the appearance of being,
19 independent and impartial, that public office not be used for private gain, and that there
20 be public confidence in the integrity of Clayton County officials and employees. Because
21 the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or
22 appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of
23 officials and employees, the public interest requires that the General Assembly protect
24 against such conflicts of interest by establishing by law appropriate ethical standards with
25 respect to the conduct of the officials and employees of Clayton County in situations
26 where a conflict may exist.
27 (2) The General Assembly recognizes that an appropriate and effective code of ethics for

440 (4) Upon receipt of the complaint, the ethics administrator shall bring the complaint

483 proceedings shall be made public by the ethics officer as soon as practicable after the
484 determination has been made.
485 (m) Violations; appeals.
