A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing April 11-17, 2025, as Black Maternal Health Week; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, Black Maternal Health Week was founded by the Black Mamas Matter
3 Alliance, Inc., to bring national attention to the maternal and reproductive health crisis in the
4 United States and the importance of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity among Black
5 women and birthing persons; and
6 WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Black women in
7 the United States are two to three times more likely than White women to die from
8 pregnancy-related causes; and
9 WHEREAS, Black women and individuals living in low-income and rural communities in
10 the United States are among those most likely to suffer from life-threatening pregnancy
11 complications, known as maternal morbidities; and
12 WHEREAS, the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among affluent
13 countries, in part because of the disproportionate mortality rate of Black women; and

25 LC 112 3462
14 WHEREAS, in 2023, the maternal mortality rate in the United States decreased for White,
15 Hispanic, and Asian women but increased to 50.3 deaths per 100,000 live births for Black
16 women; and
17 WHEREAS, the maternal mortality rate in Georgia is 32.1 deaths per 100,000 live births, and
18 the infant mortality rate is 7.1 deaths per 1,000 live births; and
19 WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that more than 80
20 percent of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable; and
21 WHEREAS, Black women are 50 percent more likely than all other women to give birth to
22 premature, low birthweight, and very low birthweight infants; and
23 WHEREAS, the high rates of maternal mortality among Black women persist across all
24 income levels, education levels, and socioeconomic statuses; and
25 WHEREAS, the leading causes of maternal mortality among Black women and birthing
26 persons include eclampsia, preeclampsia, postpartum cardiomyopathy, and obstetric
27 embolism, all of which disproportionately impact Black women and birthing people; and
28 WHEREAS, Georgia has the highest rate of Caesarean section deliveries with 35.8 percent
29 of live births resulting in C-sections, and Black infants experienced the highest rate at 38.1
30 percent from 2021 to 2023; and
31 WHEREAS, states and rural counties with higher Black populations experience severe
32 maternity care deserts, where hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care and obstetric
33 providers are lacking, and access to reproductive health care providers is further diminished

34 due to low Medicaid reimbursements, rising costs, and persistent health care workforce
35 shortages; and
36 WHEREAS, maternity care deserts lead to higher risks of maternal morbidity and mortality,
37 as most complications occur in the postpartum period when birthing people are far from their
38 providers; and
39 WHEREAS, Black midwives, doulas, perinatal health workers, and community-based
40 organizations provide holistic maternal care and support but face structural and legal barriers
41 to licensure, reimbursement, and the provision of care; and
42 WHEREAS, Black Maternal Health Week serves as an opportunity to deepen the national
43 conversation about Black maternal health, amplify solutions, and center the voices of Black
44 women, families, and stakeholders.
45 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
46 recognize April 11-17, 2025, as Black Maternal Health Week.
47 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
48 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and the
49 press.
