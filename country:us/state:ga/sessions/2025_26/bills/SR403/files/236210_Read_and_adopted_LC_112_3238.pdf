A RESOLUTION
1 Commending Valerie Taylor; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, Valerie Taylor has devoted herself to advocating for cancer patients and their
3 families, drawing upon her own courageous battles with blood cancer and breast cancer to
4 inspire and empower others in the relentless fight for equitable healthcare access and
5 life-saving treatments; and
6 WHEREAS, Valerie's advocacy efforts began in earnest following her own diagnosis of
7 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in April 2018. After dedicating decades of her life as a nurse,
8 she was released from her job while caring for her mother, who suffered from advanced
9 dementia. As a result, she fell into Georgia's coverage gap and was left without the critical
10 healthcare coverage she neededâ€”unable to access the life-saving treatments essential for her
11 survival. Throughout this challenging journey, her son, Teferi, has been a constant source of
12 strength, supporting her both emotionally and in her advocacy efforts; and
13 WHEREAS, despite facing her own battles with cancer, including a diagnosis of breast
14 cancer in 2023, Valerie has been a tireless and passionate advocate, helping to raise
15 awareness about the crucial need to fully close the Medicaid coverage gap to protect patients
