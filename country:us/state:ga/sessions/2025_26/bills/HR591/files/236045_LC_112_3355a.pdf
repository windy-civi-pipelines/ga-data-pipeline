A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing March 14, 2025, as Black Midwives Day; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, recognizing March 14, 2025, as Black Midwives Day underscores the
3 importance of midwifery in achieving better maternal health outcomes by addressing
4 fundamental gaps in access to high-quality care and multiple aspects of well-being; and
5 WHEREAS, the inaugural Black Midwives Day (BMD) campaign, founded and led by the
6 National Black Midwives Alliance in 2023, is a day of awareness, activism, education, and
7 community building; and
8 WHEREAS, this day is intended to increase attention on the state of Black maternal health
9 in the United States, the root causes of poor maternal health outcomes, and
10 community-driven policy, program, and care solutions; and
11 WHEREAS, BMD venerates the work and contributions of past and present midwives who
12 have ushered in new life despite a history fraught with persecution, enslavement, violence,
13 racism, and the systematic erasure of community Black midwives throughout the 20th
14 century; and

15 WHEREAS, the resurgence of Black midwifery is a testament to the resilience, resistance,
16 and determination of spirit in preserving healing modalities practiced worldwideâ€”the focus
17 on holistic care, which involves caring for the whole person, family, and community, is what
18 makes a difference in midwifery; and
19 WHEREAS, midwifery honors a birthing person's right to bodily autonomy; can be
20 facilitated at home, in a birth center, or in a hospital; and works in tandem with doulas,
21 community health workers, obstetricians, pediatricians, and other health care providers; and
22 WHEREAS, Black families benefit from access to Black midwives to receive culturally
23 sensitive and congruent care established through trust and respect, backed by the wisdom of
24 time-honored techniques and best practices; and
25 WHEREAS, Black birthing people in the United States suffer from life-threatening
26 pregnancy complications, known as maternal morbidities, at twice the rate of white birthing
27 people; and
28 WHEREAS, maternal mortality rates in the United States are among the highest in the
29 developed world and are increasing rapidly; and
30 WHEREAS, these deaths have devastating effects on Black children and families, and the
31 vast majority are entirely preventable through assertive efforts to ensure Black birthing
32 people have access to information, services, and support to make their own health care
33 decisions, particularly regarding pregnancy and childbearing; and
34 WHEREAS, the high rates of maternal mortality among Black birthing people span across
35 income levels, education levels, and socioeconomic status; and

25 LC 112 3355
36 WHEREAS, structural racism, gender oppression, and the social determinants of health
37 inequities experienced by Black birthing people in the United States significantly contribute
38 to the disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity among Black
39 birthing people; and
40 WHEREAS, a fair distribution of resources, especially regarding reproductive health care
41 services, is critical to closing the racial disparity gap; and
42 WHEREAS, justice-informed, culturally congruent models such as midwifery care are
43 beneficial to Black birthing people; and
44 WHEREAS, an investment must be made in robust, quality, and comprehensive health care
45 for Black birthing people, as well as policies that support and promote affordable, holistic
46 maternal health care free from gender and racial discrimination; and
47 WHEREAS, the National Black Midwives Alliance is campaigning for Black Midwives Day
48 to strengthen the base of Black midwives and their supporters, preserve the cultural history
49 of Black midwifery as an important part of the story of America, provide advocacy tools to
50 eliminate barriers to education and resources for Black midwives, build power by developing
51 a national unified voice advocating for Black midwifery, address perinatal health disparities
52 impacting Black communities, and elevate consumer demand for access to midwifery and
53 community birth; and
54 WHEREAS, it is fitting and proper on Black Midwives Day to recognize the tremendous
55 contributions of Black midwives and their role in improving maternal health outcomes.
