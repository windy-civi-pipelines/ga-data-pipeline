Section 1:
25 LC 47 3683
House Resolution 820
of the 63rd, Scott of the 76th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Designating April 8 of each year as Black Women and Girls Awareness Day; and for other
2 purposes.
3 WHEREAS, a mature, diverse, educated population of women and girls is necessary for
4 Georgia to achieve a bright future. Since 1970, the population of women and girls in Georgia
5 has more than doubled, reaching over 5.66 million; and women have taken on an increased
6 role in the state's workforce, growing from 40 percent of the total workforce in 1970 to
7 nearly 60 percent of the total workforce today. Black women and girls in Georgia are
8 dedicated citizens who contribute to this state's vibrant culture, thriving economy, and
9 neighborly communities; and
10 WHEREAS, despite immense progress in recent decades, many Black women and girls still
11 face substantial hardships beyond those of other demographics, such as limited educational
12 opportunities, economic hardships, and unique healthcare concerns. Despite such hardship,
13 Black women and girls continue to demonstrate their commitment to the pursuit and
14 successful acquisition of education. Today, approximately 96 percent of young Black
15 women graduate high school and represent an increasing proportion of those enrolled in
16 postsecondary education. Notably, Georgia is home to Spelman College, which is a college

17 for women that is ranked No. 1 among all historically Black colleges and universities in the
18 nation by U.S. News and World Report; and
19 WHEREAS, through the course of their lifetimes, Black women and girls are at a greater risk
20 of encountering health challenges including a wide variety of deadly, yet preventable,
21 chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.
22 Additionally, Black women and girls are more likely to be the victim of domestic violence
23 and sexual assault, indicating that additional protections are necessary to reduce the incidents
24 of Black women and girls being killed, made unsafe, or reported missing in our state; and
25 WHEREAS, although Black women comprise almost 8 percent of the general population,
26 they are especially underrepresented among Science, Technology, Engineering, and
27 Mathematics (STEM) degree-holders, making up of all degrees awarded only 4.2 percent of
28 biological sciences, 2.8 percent of physical sciences, 2.6 percent of computer sciences, 2.3
29 percent of mathematics and statistics, and 0.99 percent of engineering. It is especially
30 important to target job creation, introduce high-tech skills training, and increase STEM
31 opportunities for Black women in order to reduce long-term unemployment and
32 underemployment; and
33 WHEREAS, Black women and girls play a vital role in maintaining Georgia's No. 2 ranking
34 for growth of women-owned firms, as well as the state's status of having the fifth most firms
35 owned by women. Approximately 39.1 percent of all Black-owned businesses across the
36 United States are run by women which is significantly higher than the 22.3 percent of all
37 businesses run by women in general across the United States. Additionally, Black women
38 in Georgia have the highest labor force participation rates amongst all demographics; and

41 continued success.
