34 SECTION 2.

39 funds, by revising subsection (a) as follows:
40 "(a)(1)(A)(i) Unless exempt, the telephone subscriber of any telephone service shall
41 be billed for the monthly 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to such telephone
- 2 -

25 LC 56 0343S
42 service by the service supplier. Beginning on July 1, 2025, such 9-1-1 charge shall
43 be $2.50 Such 9-1-1 charge shall be $1.50 per month per telephone service provided
44 to the telephone subscriber except as reduced pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection
45 (d) of this Code section.
46 (ii) In computing the amount due under this subsection, the number of 9-1-1 charges
47 a telephone subscriber shall be assessed shall not exceed the number of simultaneous
48 outbound calls that can be made from voice channels the service supplier has
49 activated and enabled. For telephone service that provides to multiple locations
50 shared simultaneous outbound voice channel capacity configured to and capable of
51 accessing a 9-1-1 system in different states, the monthly 9-1-1 charge shall be
52 assessed only for the portion of such shared voice channel capacity in this state as
53 identified by the service supplier's books and records. In determining the portion of
54 shared capacity in this state, a service supplier may rely on, among other factors, a
55 customer's certification of its allocation of capacity in this state, which may be based
56 on each end user location, the total number of end users, and the number of end users
57 at each end user location.
58 (B) All telephone services billed to federal, state, or local governments shall be exempt
59 from the 9-1-1 charge. Each service supplier shall, on behalf of the local government,
60 collect the 9-1-1 charge from those telephone subscribers to whom it provides
61 telephone service in the area served by the emergency 9-1-1 system. As part of its
62 normal billing process, the service supplier shall collect the 9-1-1 charge for each
63 month a telephone service is in service, and it shall list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate
64 entry on each bill. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require a service
65 supplier to list the 9-1-1 charge as a surcharge or separate entry on each bill. Service
66 suppliers that do not list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill shall remit the
67 9-1-1 charge for each telephone subscriber that pays the bill; provided, however, that
68 this information shall be maintained in a form auditors can access. If a service supplier
- 3 -

25 LC 56 0343S
69 receives a partial payment for a bill from a telephone subscriber, the service supplier
70 shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber owes the service
71 supplier first.
72 (C) This paragraph shall not apply to wireless service or prepaid wireless service or the
73 telephone subscribers or service suppliers of such services.
74 (2)(A) If the governing body of a local government operates or contracts for the
75 operation of a public safety answering point that is capable of providing or provides
76 automatic number identification of a wireless telecommunications connection and the
77 location of the base station or cell site which receives a 9-1-1 call from a wireless
78 telecommunications connection, the subscriber of a wireless telecommunications
79 connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is served by
80 the local government or that would be served by the local government for the purpose
81 of such a public safety answering point may be billed for the monthly wireless
82 enhanced 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to that connection by the wireless
83 service supplier. Beginning on July 1, 2025, such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge shall
84 be $2.50 Such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge shall be $1.50 per month per wireless
85 telecommunications connection provided to the telephone subscriber except as
86 otherwise provided in paragraph (4) of subsection (d) of this Code section.
87 (B) If the governing body of a local government operates or contracts for the operation
88 of an emergency 9-1-1 system which is capable of providing or provides automatic
89 number identification and automatic location identification of a wireless
90 telecommunications connection, the subscriber of a wireless telecommunications
91 connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is served by
92 the local government or that would be served by the local government for the purpose
93 of such an emergency 9-1-1 system may be billed for the monthly wireless enhanced
94 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to that connection by the wireless service
95 supplier. Such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge may not exceed the amount of the
- 4 -

25 LC 56 0343S
96 monthly 9-1-1 charge imposed upon other telephone subscribers pursuant to
97 paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall be imposed on a monthly basis for each
98 wireless telecommunications connection provided to the telephone subscriber.
99 (C) All wireless telecommunications connections billed to federal, state, or local
100 governments shall be exempt from the wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge. Each wireless
101 service supplier shall, on behalf of the local government, collect the wireless enhanced
102 9-1-1 charge from those telephone subscribers whose place of primary use is within the
103 geographic area that is served by the local government or that would be served by the
104 local government for the purpose of such an emergency 9-1-1 system. As part of its
105 normal billing process, the wireless service supplier shall collect the wireless
106 enhanced 9-1-1 charge for each month a wireless telecommunications connection is in
107 service, and it may list the wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each
108 bill. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require a wireless service
109 supplier to list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill. Wireless service
110 suppliers that do not list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill shall remit the
111 9-1-1 charge for each telephone subscriber that pays the bill; provided, however, that
112 this information shall be maintained in a form auditors can access. If a wireless service
113 supplier receives partial payment for a bill from a telephone subscriber, the wireless
114 service supplier shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber
115 owes the wireless service supplier first.
116 (D) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the application of any 9-1-1 service charge with
117 respect to a mobile telecommunications service, as defined in 4 U.S.C. Section 124(7),
118 shall be governed by the provisions of Code Section 48-8-6.
119 (E) This paragraph shall not apply to prepaid wireless service or the telephone
120 subscribers or service suppliers of such service."

125 "(b)(1) Counties and municipalities that operate a 9-1-1 public safety answering point,
126 including counties and municipalities that operate multijurisdictional or regional 9-1-1
127 systems or have created a joint authority pursuant to Code Section 46-5-138, are

131 requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (j) of this Code section. Any charge imposed
132 by ordinance pursuant to this subsection prior to July 1, 2025, shall, beginning on
