25 LC 56 0342
41 relating to billing of subscribers, liability of subscriber for service charge, taxes on service,
42 establishment of Emergency Telephone System Fund, cost recovery fee, records, and use of
43 funds, by revising subsection (a) as follows:
44 "(a)(1)(A)(i) Unless exempt, the telephone subscriber of any telephone service shall
45 be billed for the monthly 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to such telephone
46 service by the service supplier. Beginning on July 1, 2026, such 9-1-1 charge shall
47 be $2.50 Such 9-1-1 charge shall be $1.50 per month per telephone service provided
48 to the telephone subscriber except as reduced pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection
49 (d) of this Code section.
50 (ii) In computing the amount due under this subsection, the number of 9-1-1 charges
51 a telephone subscriber shall be assessed shall not exceed the number of simultaneous
52 outbound calls that can be made from voice channels the service supplier has
53 activated and enabled. For telephone service that provides to multiple locations
54 shared simultaneous outbound voice channel capacity configured to and capable of
55 accessing a 9-1-1 system in different states, the monthly 9-1-1 charge shall be
56 assessed only for the portion of such shared voice channel capacity in this state as
57 identified by the service supplier's books and records. In determining the portion of
58 shared capacity in this state, a service supplier may rely on, among other factors, a
59 customer's certification of its allocation of capacity in this state, which may be based
60 on each end user location, the total number of end users, and the number of end users
61 at each end user location.
62 (B) All telephone services billed to federal, state, or local governments shall be exempt
63 from the 9-1-1 charge. Each service supplier shall, on behalf of the local government,
64 collect the 9-1-1 charge from those telephone subscribers to whom it provides
65 telephone service in the area served by the emergency 9-1-1 system. As part of its
66 normal billing process, the service supplier shall collect the 9-1-1 charge for each
67 month a telephone service is in service, and it shall list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate
S. B. 285

25 LC 56 0342
68 entry on each bill. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require a service
69 supplier to list the 9-1-1 charge as a surcharge or separate entry on each bill. Service
70 suppliers that do not list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill shall remit the
71 9-1-1 charge for each telephone subscriber that pays the bill; provided, however, that
72 this information shall be maintained in a form auditors can access. If a service supplier
73 receives a partial payment for a bill from a telephone subscriber, the service supplier
74 shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber owes the service
75 supplier first.
76 (C) This paragraph shall not apply to wireless service or prepaid wireless service or the
77 telephone subscribers or service suppliers of such services.
78 (2)(A) If the governing body of a local government operates or contracts for the
79 operation of a public safety answering point that is capable of providing or provides
80 automatic number identification of a wireless telecommunications connection and the
81 location of the base station or cell site which receives a 9-1-1 call from a wireless
82 telecommunications connection, the subscriber of a wireless telecommunications
83 connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is served by
84 the local government or that would be served by the local government for the purpose
85 of such a public safety answering point may be billed for the monthly wireless
86 enhanced 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to that connection by the wireless
87 service supplier. Beginning on July 1, 2026, such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge shall
88 be $2.50 Such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge shall be $1.50 per month per wireless
89 telecommunications connection provided to the telephone subscriber except as
90 otherwise provided in paragraph (4) of subsection (d) of this Code section.
91 (B) If the governing body of a local government operates or contracts for the operation
92 of an emergency 9-1-1 system which is capable of providing or provides automatic
93 number identification and automatic location identification of a wireless
94 telecommunications connection, the subscriber of a wireless telecommunications

95 connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is served by
96 the local government or that would be served by the local government for the purpose
97 of such an emergency 9-1-1 system may be billed for the monthly wireless enhanced
98 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to that connection by the wireless service
99 supplier. Such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge may not exceed the amount of the
100 monthly 9-1-1 charge imposed upon other telephone subscribers pursuant to
101 paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall be imposed on a monthly basis for each
102 wireless telecommunications connection provided to the telephone subscriber.
103 (C) All wireless telecommunications connections billed to federal, state, or local
104 governments shall be exempt from the wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge. Each wireless
105 service supplier shall, on behalf of the local government, collect the wireless enhanced
106 9-1-1 charge from those telephone subscribers whose place of primary use is within the
107 geographic area that is served by the local government or that would be served by the
108 local government for the purpose of such an emergency 9-1-1 system. As part of its
109 normal billing process, the wireless service supplier shall collect the wireless
110 enhanced 9-1-1 charge for each month a wireless telecommunications connection is in
111 service, and it may list the wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each
112 bill. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require a wireless service
113 supplier to list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill. Wireless service
114 suppliers that do not list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill shall remit the
115 9-1-1 charge for each telephone subscriber that pays the bill; provided, however, that
116 this information shall be maintained in a form auditors can access. If a wireless service
117 supplier receives partial payment for a bill from a telephone subscriber, the wireless
118 service supplier shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber
119 owes the wireless service supplier first.

120 (D) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the application of any 9-1-1 service charge with
121 respect to a mobile telecommunications service, as defined in 4 U.S.C. Section 124(7),
122 shall be governed by the provisions of Code Section 48-8-6.
123 (E) This paragraph shall not apply to prepaid wireless service or the telephone
124 subscribers or service suppliers of such service."
125 SECTION 3.
126 Said part is further amended in Code Section 46-5-134.2, relating to prepaid wireless 9-1-1
127 charge, definitions, imposition of fee by localities, collection and remission of charges, and
128 distribution of funds, by revising subsection (b) as follows:
129 "(b)(1) Counties and municipalities that operate a 9-1-1 public safety answering point,
130 including counties and municipalities that operate multijurisdictional or regional 9-1-1
131 systems or have created a joint authority pursuant to Code Section 46-5-138, are
132 authorized to impose by ordinance or resolution a prepaid wireless 9-1-1 charge in the
133 amount of $1.50 $2.50 per retail transaction. Imposition of the charge authorized by this
134 Code section by a county or municipality shall be contingent upon compliance with the
135 requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (j) of this Code section. Any charge imposed
136 by ordinance pursuant to this subsection prior to July 1, 2026, shall, beginning on
137 July 1, 2026, be in the amount of $2.50.
138 (2) Where a county or municipality that operates a 9-1-1 public safety answering point
139 fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (j) of this Code
140 section by December 31, 2011, on and after that date, the prepaid wireless 9-1-1 charge

153 be paid for each month of additional service credit, provided that the member either has at
154 least ten years of membership service, or 15 years of membership service for individuals
155 who became members on or after July 1, 2010, and is at least 55 years of age or has at
