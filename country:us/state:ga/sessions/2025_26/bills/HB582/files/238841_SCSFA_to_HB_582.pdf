77 SECTION 5.
78 Title 17 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to criminal procedure, is
79 amended in Article 1 of Chapter 10, relating to procedure for sentencing and imposition of
80 punishment, by revising subsection (f) of Code Section 17-10-1, relating to fixing of
81 sentence, suspension or probation of sentence, change in sentence, eligibility for parole,
82 prohibited modifications, and exceptions, as follows:
83 "(f)(1) Within one year of the date upon which the sentence is imposed, or within 120
84 days after receipt by the sentencing court of the remittitur upon affirmance of the
85 judgment after direct appeal, whichever is later, the court imposing the sentence has the

88 subsection require the defendant to file a motion within such time periods; however, the
89 court shall not be constrained to issue its order or hear the matter within such time
90 periods. Prior to entering any order correcting, reducing, or modifying any sentence, the
91 court shall afford notice and an opportunity for a hearing to the prosecuting attorney.
92 Any order modifying a sentence which is entered without notice and an opportunity for
- 4 -

25 HB 582/SCSFA
93 a hearing as provided in this subsection shall be void. This subsection shall not limit any
94 other jurisdiction granted to the court in this Code section or as provided for in subsection
95 (g) of Code Section 42-8-34.
96 (2)(A) A person who is serving a sentence may submit a petition to the court

99 (ii) The petition includes evidence that was not part of the record of the case at any
100 sentencing hearing.
101 (B) Such petition shall be served upon the district attorney. The state shall file its
102 response, if any, within 60 days of being served with such petition. The superior court
103 shall, upon motion for an extension of time and after a hearing and good cause shown,
104 grant one extension to the original 60 day period, not to exceed 180 additional days.
105 (C) There shall be a presumption in favor of granting a hearing on a petition filed
106 pursuant to this paragraph unless the court determines that there is a lack of
107 circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, an inherent unreliability of the facts
108 asserted, or a deficiency in the factual allegations in the petition. If the court decides
109 that the petitioner is not entitled to a hearing, the court shall enter an order denying
110 relief and shall include written findings of fact outlining the reasons for such order.
111 (D) A hearing on a petition filed pursuant to this paragraph, if granted, shall be
112 scheduled within 90 days of the filing of such petition or within 60 days of the deadline
113 for the state's response, whichever is later. The state shall be given notice and the
114 opportunity to respond at any such hearing.
115 (E)(i) If, based upon evidence presented at the hearing, the court determines that the
116 petitioner has met the criteria provided in subsection (b) of Code Section 17-10-22,
117 the court shall enter an order reducing the defendant's sentence pursuant to
118 subsection (c) of Code Section 17-10-22.
- 5 -

25 HB 582/SCSFA
119 (ii) If, based upon the petition or evidence presented at the hearing, the court
120 determines that the petitioner has not met the criteria provided in subsection (b) of
121 Code Section 17-10-22, the court shall notify the petitioner, dismiss his or her petition
122 without prejudice, and enter an order to such effect. Such an order shall include
123 written findings of fact outlining the reasons for such order.
124 (F) Any order issued by a court pursuant to this paragraph shall include written
125 findings of fact and the reasons for such order.
126 (G) Any judgments pursuant to this paragraph shall be final judgments and subject to
127 direct appeal by the petitioner and the state under Code Sections 5-6-34 and 5-7-1."
128 SECTION 6.
129 Said title is further amended in said article by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
130 "17-10-22.

150 19-13-1, 19-13A-1, and 19-15-1, respectively, including, but not limited to, temporary
151 protective order petitions, ex parte orders, and final orders in which the alleged
152 perpetrator is the respondent;

156 (10) Any other evidence that the court determines is of sufficient credibility or probative
157 value.
158 (b) The court shall impose a sentence as provided in subsection (c) of this Code section

161 violence, dating violence, or child abuse, as such acts are described in Code Sections
162 19-13-1, 19-13A-1, and 19-15-1, respectively, and such acts were a significant
163 contributing factor to the offense; or
164 (2) The best interest of justice and welfare of society would be served; provided,
165 however, that such finding shall only be entered with the consent of the state.
166 (c) Upon a finding provided for in subsection (b) of this Code section:
167 (1) A person convicted of a crime punishable by death or by life imprisonment shall be
168 punished by imprisonment for not less than ten years nor more than 30 years. In the

25 HB 582/SCSFA
170 the prosecuting attorney and the defendant have agreed to a sentence that is below such
171 mandatory minimum. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, such
172 sentence may be reduced by any form of parole or early release administered by the State
173 Board of Pardons and Paroles or by any earned time, early release, work release, leave,
174 or other sentence-reducing measures under programs administered by the Department of
175 Corrections.
176 (2) A person convicted of a felony other than a felony punishable by death or life
177 imprisonment shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than

273 shall take the oath set forth in Code Section 15-16-4; provided, however, that any language
