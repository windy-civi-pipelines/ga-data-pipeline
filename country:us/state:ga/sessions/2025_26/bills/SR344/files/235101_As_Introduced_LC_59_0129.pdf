A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the Senate Study Committee on a Single-payer Healthcare Program; and for other
2 purposes.
3
4 WHEREAS, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted by Congress
5 in 2010, fundamentally reforming the American healthcare system, by expanding Medicaid
6 to 138 percent of the federal poverty line and making various changes to the health insurance
7 industry; and
8 WHEREAS, the State of Georgia has refused to implement Medicaid expansion as
9 contemplated by the ACA, leaving nearly 300,000 Georgians uninsured; and
10 WHEREAS, most other highly developed countries, including Australia, Canada, India,
11 Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom, have single-payer
12 healthcare systems of some kind; and
13 WHEREAS, opinion polls have shown that countries with single-payer healthcare systems
14 almost universally prefer their systems over an American-style private healthcare system;

16 WHEREAS, various proposals have been introduced in Congress to create a nation-wide
17 single-payer healthcare system, and many states, including California, Colorado, Hawaii, and
18 Vermont, have explored the creation of a single-payer healthcare system at the state level;
19 and
20 WHEREAS, studies have shown that the United States would save approximately half a
21 trillion dollars every year under a single-payer system, and that as many as 212,000 lives
22 could have been saved during the COVID-19 pandemic; and
23 WHEREAS, the implementation of a single-payer healthcare system in Georgia would
24 significantly improve healthcare outcomes in this state; and

26 implementation of a single-payer healthcare system.
