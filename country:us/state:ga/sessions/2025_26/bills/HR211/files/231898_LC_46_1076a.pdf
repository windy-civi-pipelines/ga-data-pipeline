House Resolution 211
By: Representatives Cannon of the 58th, McQueen of the 61st, Miller of the 62nd, Paris of the
142nd, and Au of the 50th
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing the importance of hyperemesis gravidarum and encouraging this state's research
2 institutions to study this issue to improve the quality of life for pregnant people impacted by
3 this condition; and for other purposes.
4 WHEREAS, having adequate maternal healthcare support by healthcare providers is key to
5 better outcomes; and
6 WHEREAS, the failure to provide adequate healthcare support is often dismissed, leading
7 to negative outcomes, whether such outcomes are psychosocial or detrimental to the physical
8 health of the mother and infant; and
9 WHEREAS, hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting during
10 pregnancy sufficient enough to produce weight loss greater than 5 percent, dehydration,
11 ketosis, alkalosis, and hypokalemia; and
12 WHEREAS, antenatal follow-up, number of previous births, family history of hyperemesis
13 gravidarum, and exercise before pregnancy were significantly associated with outcomes; and

14 WHEREAS, lifestyle modifications, early treatment, and early ultrasound scans for pregnant
15 women are crucial to reducing the burden of hyperemesis gravidarum; and
16 WHEREAS, a large majority of those with this condition reported that hyperemesis
17 gravidarum caused negative psychosocial changes, consisting of socioeconomic changes,
18 including job loss or difficulties; attitude changes, including fear regarding future
19 pregnancies; and psychiatric sequelae, including feelings of depression and anxiety, which
20 for some continued postpartum. Patients who reported that their healthcare providers were
21 uncaring or unaware of the severity of their symptoms were nearly twice as likely to report
22 these psychiatric sequelae; and
23 WHEREAS, one challenge with hyperemesis gravidarum is weighing the risks of potential
24 complications and misery with possible risks of anti-vomiting (antiemetic) therapies; and
25 WHEREAS, holding effective medications until conservative measures have been attempted
26 delays needed treatment and may make vomiting more refractory; and
27 WHEREAS, there are a number of medications deemed safe with a long history of use, yet
28 newer drugs often prove more effective and do not significantly increase malformation rates;
29 and
30 WHEREAS, beyond the fetal loss rate of 34 percent, children are at risk for numerous
31 complications from hyperemesis gravidarum, especially if the symptoms are severe,
32 prolonged, or inadequately treated or there is a delay in medical intervention. Specifically,
33 weight loss over 15 percent of pre-pregnancy weight is highly predictive of adverse fetal
34 impact; and

35 WHEREAS, the exact cause of hyperemesis gravidarum is not entirely clear, but high
36 cortisol levels and stress, micronutrient deficiencies (vitamin K embryopathy or Wernicke's
37 encephalopathy), and inadequate maternal support, resources, and access to care all play a
38 role. Some problems may also be related to specific issues such as IV infection, emboli, and
39 medication side effects, and effective care is crucial; and
40 WHEREAS, hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of morning sickness that affects about
41 1 to 3 percent of pregnant women; and
42 WHEREAS, the exact number of women who experience hyperemesis gravidarum is
43 unknown because some cases may go unreported; and
44 WHEREAS, hyperemesis gravidarum is more likely to occur in multiple pregnancies; and
45 WHEREAS, hyperemesis gravidarum is characterized by persistent vomiting in the first
46 trimester that leads to weight loss; and
47 WHEREAS, patients with hyperemesis gravidarum may also experience dehydration, poor
48 skin turgor, and dry mucous membranes; and
49 WHEREAS, hyperemesis gravidarum can lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm
50 labor, fetal malformations, and low birth weight; and
51 WHEREAS, hyperemesis gravidarum can also cause negative psychosocial changes, such
52 as depression, anxiety, and fear of future pregnancies; and

53 WHEREAS, being underweight before pregnancy may be a risk factor for hyperemesis
54 gravidarum; and
55 WHEREAS, multiple gestations, molar pregnancies, and fetal anomalies may also increase
56 the risk of hyperemesis gravidarum.
57 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
58 the members of this body recognize the importance of hyperemesis gravidarum and
59 encourage the research institutions of this state to study this issue to improve the quality of
60 life for pregnant people impacted by this condition.
61 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
62 and directed to send copies of this resolution to each president of a research institution in this
63 state and make further appropriate copies available for distribution to the public and the
64 press.
