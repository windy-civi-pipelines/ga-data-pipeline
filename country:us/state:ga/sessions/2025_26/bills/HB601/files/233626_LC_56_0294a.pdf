702 personnel files that relates to an applicant's, candidate's, or peace officer's performance
703 or behavior while employed by such prior employer, including performance evaluations,

705 information prohibited from disclosure by federal law or any document not in the
706 possession of the employer at the time a request for such information is received.
707 (2) Where an investigation is conducted for the purpose of hiring, certifying, or
708 continuing the certification of a peace officer, an employer shall disclose employment
709 related information to the investigating law enforcement agency upon receiving a written
710 request from such agency. Disclosure shall only be required under this subsection if the
711 law enforcement agency's request is accompanied by a copy of a signed, notarized
712 statement from the applicant, candidate, or peace officer releasing and holding harmless
713 such employer from any and all liability for disclosing complete and accurate information
714 to the law enforcement agency.
715 (3) An employer may charge a reasonable fee to cover actual costs incurred in copying
716 and furnishing documents to a requesting law enforcement agency, including retrieving
717 and redacting costs, provided that such amount shall not exceed $25.00 or 25¢ per page,
718 whichever is greater. No employer shall be required to prepare or create any document
719 not already in the employer's possession at the time a request for employment related
720 information is received. Any employment related information provided pursuant to this
721 subsection that is not subject to public disclosure while in the possession of a prior
722 employer shall continue to be privileged and protected from public disclosure as a record
723 of the requesting law enforcement agency.
724 (4) No employer or law enforcement agency shall be subject to any civil liability for any
725 cause of action by virtue of disclosing complete and accurate information to a law
726 enforcement agency in good faith and without malice pursuant to this subsection. In any
727 such cause of action, malice or bad faith shall only be demonstrated by clear and
728 convincing evidence. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed so as to
729 affect or limit rights or remedies provided by federal law.
730 (5) Before taking final action on an application for employment based, in whole or in
731 part, on any unfavorable employment related information received from a previous

732 employer, a law enforcement agency shall inform the applicant, candidate, or peace
733 officer that it has received such employment related information and that the applicant,
734 candidate, or peace officer may inspect and respond in writing to such information. Upon
735 the applicant's, candidate's, or peace officer's request, the law enforcement agency shall
736 allow him or her to inspect the employment related information and to submit a written
737 response to such information. The request for inspection shall be made within five
738 business days from the date that the applicant, candidate, or peace officer is notified of
739 the law enforcement agency's receipt of such employment related information. The
740 inspection shall occur not later than ten business days after said notification. Any
741 response to the employment related information shall be made by the applicant,
742 candidate, or peace officer not later than three business days after his or her inspection.
743 (6) No person shall be certified, or allowed to continue in his or her certification, or hired
744 as a peace officer if an investigation undertaken pursuant to this subsection determines
745 that such individual has ever been terminated from a position as a peace officer based on
746 misconduct related to such position.
747 (7) Nothing contained in this Code section shall be construed so as to require any person
748 to provide self-incriminating information or otherwise to compel any person to act in
749 violation of his or her right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the United States
750 Constitution and Article I, Section I, Paragraph XVI of the Georgia Constitution. It shall
751 not be a violation of this Code section for a person to fail to provide requested
752 information based on a claim that such information is self-incriminating, provided that
753 notice of such claim is served in lieu of the requested information. An action against
754 such person to require disclosure on the grounds that the claim of self-incrimination is not
755 substantiated may be brought in the superior court of the county of such party's residence
756 or where such information is located."
