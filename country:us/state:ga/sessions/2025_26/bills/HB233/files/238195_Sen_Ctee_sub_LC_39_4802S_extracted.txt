Section 1:
25 LC 39 4802S
substitute to HB 233:
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Chapter 4 of Title 1 and Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated,
2 relating to holidays and observances and state government, respectively, so as to designate
3 the fourth Friday in November of each year as "National Sugarcane Syrup Day" in Georgia;
4 to designate Brunswick stew as the official state stew; to designate cornbread as the official
5 state bread; to provide for legislative findings; to prohibit companies owned or operated by
6 a foreign country of concern from submitting a proposal for a contract with a state agency
7 for goods or services; to provide for related matters; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other
8 purposes.
9 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
10 PART I
11 SECTION 1-1.
12 The General Assembly finds that:
13 (1) Making sugarcane syrup has been a part of family farm tradition for generations,
14 particularly in Georgia;
- 1 -
25 LC 39 4802S
15 (2) The increase in production costs, competition from artificial syrups, and the decreasing
16 number of farmers who still make sugarcane syrup, however, has led some to refer to the
17 making of sugarcane syrup as a dying art;
18 (3) Establishing a "National Sugarcane Syrup Day" in Georgia would help to preserve the
19 art of making sugarcane syrup by honoring those who continue with this longstanding
20 family farm tradition and by raising public awareness of the differences between natural
21 sugarcane syrup and artificial syrups;
22 (4) Designating the fourth Friday in November of each year, the day after Thanksgiving,
23 as "National Sugarcane Syrup Day" is particularly fitting, as it is not only a time when
24 families gather and celebrate together, but also a time when some say sugarcane is at its
25 sweetest in Georgia; and
26 (5) It is, therefore, abundantly fitting and proper that the State of Georgia appropriately
27 recognize and honor the family farm tradition of making sugarcane syrup by designating
28 the fourth Friday in November of each year as "National Sugarcane Syrup Day" in Georgia.
29 SECTION 1-2.
30 Chapter 4 of Title 1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to holidays and
31 observances, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
32 "1-4-27.
33 The fourth Friday in November of each year is designated as 'National Sugarcane Syrup
34 Day' in Georgia."
35 PART II
36 SECTION 2-1.
37 The General Assembly of Georgia finds and determines that:
- 2 -
25 LC 39 4802S
38 (1) Brunswick stew is a rich, thick stew noted for its signature ingredients of meat,
39 tomatoes, and fresh vegetables, such as sweet corn;
40 (2) A plaque on an old iron pot in Brunswick, Georgia, declares the first Brunswick stew
41 was made in it on July 2, 1898, on nearby St. Simons Island; and
42 (3) Contrary to claims by other states, Georgia, and specifically Brunswick, Georgia, is the
43 birthplace of Brunswick stew.
44 SECTION 2-2.
45 Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state government, is amended
46 by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
47 "50-3-94.
48 Brunswick stew is designated as the official Georgia state stew."
49 PART III
50 SECTION 3-1.
51 The General Assembly finds and declares that:
52 (1) The colorful history and traditions of the State of Georgia are inextricably associated
53 with the food traditions of corn, and among the many legacies of this proud heritage is the
54 delicious bread known as cornbread;
55 (2) Relied upon by indigenous people to sustain themselves, cornbread has transcended
56 its humble origins to take a place of honor at such events as the Prater's Mill Country Fair
57 in Whitfield County;
58 (3) With thousands of participants and visitors, such celebrations include cornbread
59 cooked on a wood-burning stove and served with collard greens and pinto beans;
- 3 -
25 LC 39 4802S
60 (4) Corn is grown, ground, and made into cornmeal at historic mills like Prater's Mill,
61 Berry College Mill, and Ogeechee River Mill and modern mills like Southeastern Mills and
62 Logan Turnpike Mill;
63 (5) Cornmeal is then sold in stores and served in eating establishments throughout the
64 state, and cornbread is enjoyed by young and old at home and in restaurants;
65 (6) Cornbread enjoys a singular stature in Georgia history and culture that is rivaled only
66 by its undeniable appeal as a versatile and satisfying food; and
67 (7) Accordingly, it is abundantly fitting and proper that cornbread be designated as the
68 official Georgia state bread so as to fully recognize the importance of this product to this
69 state.
70 SECTION 3-2.
71 Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state government, is amended
72 by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
73 "50-3-95.
74 Cornbread is designated as the official Georgia state bread."
75 PART IV
76 SECTION 4-1.
77 Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state government, is amended
78 by revising Code Section 50-5-84.2, relating to contracting with companies owned by China,
79 as follows:
80 "50-5-84.2.
81 (a) As used in this Code section, the term:

83 partnership, joint venture, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited

84 liability company, or other entity or business association, including all wholly owned
85 subsidiaries, majority owned subsidiaries, or parent companies, or affiliates of such
86 entities or business associations, that exists for the purpose of making profit.

88 Communist Party.
89 (2) 'Foreign country of concern' means a country whose government is designated as a
90 foreign adversary by the United States Secretary of Commerce pursuant to 15 C.F.R.
91 Section 791.4.
92 (3) 'Scrutinized company' means any company owned or operated by the government of
93 China a foreign country of concern or any company in which the government of a foreign
94 country of concern has an ownership stake.
95 (b) A scrutinized company shall be ineligible to, and shall not, bid on or submit a proposal
96 for a contract, directly or through a third-party seller, with a state agency for goods or
97 services, including, but not limited to, a contract for the procurement or purchase of
98 computers, printers, connecting cables, or interoperable videoconferencing services used
99 in connection with an office environment.
100 (c) A state agency shall require a company that submits a bid or proposal with respect to
101 a contract for goods or services to certify that the company is not a scrutinized company.
102 (d) If the Department of Administrative Services determines that a company has submitted
103 a false certification under subsection (c) of this Code section:
104 (1) The company shall be liable for a civil penalty in an amount that is equal to the
105 greater of $250,000.00 or twice triple the amount of the contract for which a bid or
