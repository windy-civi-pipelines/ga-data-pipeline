1 To amend Article 3 of Chapter 3 of Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated,

8 SECTION 1.
9 The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
10 (1) The colorful history and traditions of the State of Georgia are inextricably associated
11 with the food traditions of root vegetables and greens, which are chock-full of vitamins
12 and minerals that are healthy for us, and among the many legacies of this proud heritage
13 is the delicious dish and its liquid, a dipping sauce known as collard greens with
14 "potlikka";
15 (2) Collard greens' "potlikka" serves as an especially excellent dipping sauce for all
16 manner of breads;

17 (3) During the holidays, tens of thousands of Georgians especially enjoy dipping
18 cornbread, the official Georgia state bread, in their collard greens with "potlikka";
19 (4) Collard greens with "potlikka" enjoy a singular stature in Georgia history and culture
20 that is rivaled only by its undeniable appeal as a unique and satisfying food. Establishing
21 collard greens as the official Georgia state greens and "potlikka" as the official Georgia
22 state dipping sauce of the official Georgia state bread is necessary to fully recognize the
23 importance of this product to this state; and
24 (5) The State of Georgia is the second highest producer in the country of collards, with
25 almost 20 percent of the state's farmed acreage and almost 30,000 acres devoted to the
26 crop.
27 SECTION 2.
28 Article 3 of Chapter 3 of Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to other
29 state symbols, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
30 "50-3-94.
31 Collard greens are designated as the official Georgia state greens, and 'potlikka' is
32 designated as the official Georgia state dipping sauce of the official Georgia state bread."
33 SECTION 3.
34 This Act shall become effective on July 1, 2025, only if an Act to provide for the designation
35 of cornbread as the official Georgia state bread becomes effective on or before July 1, 2025.
36 If such an Act does not become law, then this Act shall not become effective and shall stand
37 repealed on July 1, 2025.
38 SECTION 4.
39 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
