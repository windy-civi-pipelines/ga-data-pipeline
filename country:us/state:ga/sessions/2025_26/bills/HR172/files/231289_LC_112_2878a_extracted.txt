House Resolution 172
62nd, Bazemore of the 69th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing February 7, 2025, as Wear Red Day; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women, claiming more
3 lives than all forms of cancer combined, yet only 44 percent of women recognize that
4 cardiovascular disease is their greatest health threat; and
5 WHEREAS, among females 20 years and older, nearly 45 percent are living with some form
6 of cardiovascular disease, and less than half of women entering pregnancy in the United
7 States have optimal cardiovascular health; and
8 WHEREAS, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of maternal death in the United
9 States, or more simply put, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of new moms; and
10 WHEREAS, overall, 10 to 20 percent of women will have a health issue during pregnancy,
11 and the presence of high blood pressure, preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes during
12 pregnancy greatly increases a woman's risk for developing cardiovascular disease later in
13 life; and

25 LC 112 2878
14 WHEREAS, in 2020, stroke caused the deaths of 90,627 females, approximately 56.5 percent
15 of total stroke deaths; and
16 WHEREAS, women who experience ischemic strokes are less likely to be transported to the
17 hospital by emergency medical services or receive prompt imaging and blood thinners and
18 are more likely to die within 30 days of stroke hospitalization; and
19 WHEREAS, women are often less likely to receive bystander CPR because rescuers fear
20 accusations of inappropriate touching; and
21 WHEREAS, there are significant biological differences between men and women, and
22 clinical trials have not always adequately enrolled women or analyzed sex-specific
23 differences in the data; as of 2020, only 38 percent of cardiovascular clinical research trial
24 participants are women; and
25 WHEREAS, since 2004, the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women® movement
26 has addressed the awareness and clinical care gaps of women's greatest health threat,
27 cardiovascular disease, and it continues to make bold moves to save lives and pioneer
28 scientific discoveries.
29 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
30 the members of this body recognize February 7, 2025, as Wear Red Day in acknowledgment
31 of the importance of the ongoing fight against heart disease and stroke.
32 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
33 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
34 public and the press.
