57 the sum of $1,350,000.00 to Mr. Michael Woolfolk as compensation as provided above.
58 Said sum shall be paid from funds appropriated to or available to the Department of
59 Administrative Services and shall be paid subject to the provisions of this resolution. After
60 an initial payment of $445,500.00, the remainder of said sum shall be paid immediately into
61 a commercial annuity account bearing interest at the prevailing market rate, payable in equal
62 monthly installments over a ten-year period of time beginning in 2026 with interest payable
63 to Mr. Michael Woolfolk. The State of Georgia shall be entitled to a credit equal to the
64 amount it pays under this resolution should Mr. Michael Woolfolk recover damages as a
65 result of a lawsuit against any state official or employee acting in an official capacity whose
66 tort liability for wrongful conviction arises from the same circumstances as described in this
67 resolution, less any attorney's fees or costs Mr. Michael Woolfolk paid in obtaining those
68 damages. Should Mr. Michael Woolfolk recover damages totaling less than the amount the
69 State of Georgia pays under this resolution, the State of Georgia shall be entitled to a partial
70 credit no greater than the amount of damages Mr. Michael Woolfolk recovers less any
71 attorney's fees or costs Mr. Michael Woolfolk paid in obtaining those damages. Upon the
72 death of Mr. Michael Woolfolk, all payments and all obligations of the State of Georgia with
73 respect to any and all future payments with respect to the annuity shall continue to be made
74 to his estate or heirs.
75 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any amount received by Mr. Michael Woolfolk pursuant
76 to this resolution shall be excluded from his taxable net income for state income tax
77 purposes.
