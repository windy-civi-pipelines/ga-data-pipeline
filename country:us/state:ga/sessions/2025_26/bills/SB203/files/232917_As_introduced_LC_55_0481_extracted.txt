25
26 46-3-82.
27 As used in this part, the term:
28 (1) 'Avoided cost' means the incremental cost to an electric utility which, but for the

32 solar facility allocated to a subscriber's electricity bill pursuant to the community solar
33 program created by the commission and subject to commission jurisdiction as described
34 in this part.

36 (A) Generates electric energy that is fueled solely by ambient sunlight and is connected
37 to the electric utility's distribution system;

72 (5) May transfer or retire on behalf of subscribers the renewable energy credits produced
73 by its community solar facilities; and
74 (6) Shall be subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the commission pursuant to
75 this part; provided, however, that the sale or transfer of subscriptions shall not be
76 considered the provision of electric service to the public, retail electric service, or retail
77 supply of electricity and neither the subscriber nor the community solar organization shall
78 be considered an electric supplier within the meaning of Part 1 of this article or in
79 violation of exclusive electric service rights arising therein.

87 cost components;
88 (2) Excess credits on a subscriber's bill shall role over from month to month until the end
89 of each calendar year and any such excess credits shall automatically be applied to the
