25 LC 112 3442
15 WHEREAS, prior to the passage of House Bill 182, 14 judicial circuits lacked a dedicated

18 full-time judges and 27 part-time judges; and
19 WHEREAS, on the 25th anniversary of the passage of this landmark funding bill, which
20 would not have succeeded without Judge Culpepper's leadership, it is fitting to celebrate his

23 the members of this body recognize and commend Judge Bryant Culpepper Jr. for his
24 outstanding public service and dedication to the administration of justice.
