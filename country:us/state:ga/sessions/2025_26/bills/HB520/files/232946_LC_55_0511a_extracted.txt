292 (2) Regardless of the advice given or order issued, the responsibility and liability for
293 caring for the client shall be that of the licensed midwife.
294 (3) The provider giving the order shall be responsible and liable only for the
295 appropriateness of the order, given the briefing or data received.
296 (4) The issuing of an order for a licensed midwife's client shall not constitute a
297 delegation of duties from the other provider to the licensed midwife.

319 such representatives shall not hold themselves out as licensed midwives unless such
320 representatives are licensed under this chapter; or
321 (4) Precepted apprentices, student midwives, and midwifery assistants from providing
322 midwifery services under the supervision and in the physical presence of a licensed

332 care covered by the policy, plan, or coverage.
333 43-24B-19.
334 Any violation of this chapter or any rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter

293 caring for the client shall be that of the licensed midwife.
294 (3) The provider giving the order shall be responsible and liable only for the
295 appropriateness of the order, given the briefing or data received.
296 (4) The issuing of an order for a licensed midwife's client shall not constitute a

320 representatives are licensed under this chapter; or
321 (4) Precepted apprentices, student midwives, and midwifery assistants from providing
322 midwifery services under the supervision and in the physical presence of a licensed
