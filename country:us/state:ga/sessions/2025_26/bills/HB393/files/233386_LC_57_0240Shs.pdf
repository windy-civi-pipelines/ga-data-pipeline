16 his or her left hand and arm extended upward and shall signal a left turn with his or her left
17 hand and arm extended horizontally not less than 50 feet prior to such person completing
18 the turn; provided, however, that no arm and hand signals shall be required when doing so
19 would create an unsafe condition as to endanger any person.
20 (d) Any person operating a bicycle while approaching a stop sign at an intersection or
21 junction with a highway with two or fewer lanes shall slow down to a speed reasonable for
22 the existing conditions and, if required for safety, shall stop at the point nearest the
23 roadway of such intersection or junction where the operator of the bicycle has a view of
24 approaching traffic before entering such intersection or junction. After slowing to a
25 reasonable speed or stopping, the operator of the bicycle shall yield the right of way to any
26 pedestrian or vehicle in the intersection or junction or approaching on another highway so
27 closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time the operator of the bicycle is
28 moving across or within the intersection or junction; provided, however, that, after slowing
29 to a reasonable speed, the operator of the bicycle may make a turn or proceed through an
30 intersection or junction without stopping when no other pedestrian or vehicle is
31 approaching the intersection or junction so closely as to constitute a hazard for the operator
32 of the bicycle to turn or proceed."
33 SECTION 3.
34 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
