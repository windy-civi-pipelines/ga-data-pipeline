25 LC 129 0061
15 WHEREAS, CRNAs are anesthesia professionals who safely administer more than 50
16 million anesthetics to patients each year in the United States, and as advanced practice
17 registered nurses, CRNAs are among the nation's most trusted professions; and
18 WHEREAS, CRNAs represent more than 80 percent of the anesthesia providers in rural
19 counties, and many rural hospitals often rely on independently practicing CRNAs for
20 anesthesia care; and
21 WHEREAS, half of all rural hospitals in the United States use a CRNA-only model for
22 obstetric care, and CRNAs safely deliver pain management care, particularly where there are
23 no physician providers available, saving patients long drives of 75 miles or more; and
24 WHEREAS, it is abundantly fitting and proper that these outstanding medical professionals
25 be appropriately honored.
26 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
27 recognize and commend Georgia's Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists for their
28 dedication to the health and well-being of the citizens of this state and extend best wishes for
