17 such current use assessment and ending on the last day of December of the final year of the

19 assessment provided for in this Code section, it shall not be necessary to make application
20 thereafter for any year in which the covenant period is in effect and current use assessment

28 renewal contract in the ninth year of a covenant period so that the contract is continued
