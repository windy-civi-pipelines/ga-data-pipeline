290 specifically provided in the professional employer agreement; and

292 insurance, fidelity bonds, surety bonds, employer's liability which is not covered by
293 workers' compensation, or liquor liability insurance carried by the PEO solely as the
294 result of being a covered employee of a PEO unless covered employees are included by

246 eligibility is determined based on the number of covered employees employed by the

292 insurance, fidelity bonds, surety bonds, employer's liability which is not covered by
293 workers' compensation, or liquor liability insurance carried by the PEO solely as the
294 result of being a covered employee of a PEO unless covered employees are included by

320 professional employer agreement;
321 (3) Any tax assessed or assessment or mandated expenditure on a per capita or per

347 unless the PEO and the client have each expressly agreed to such an exception, which
348 shall become an addendum to the professional employment agreement; or
349 (4) Create any new or additional enforceable right of a covered employee against a PEO

25 LC 52 0687
473 "34-7-6.
474 (a) As used in this Code section, the term 'professional employer organization' means an
475 employee leasing company as defined in Code Section 34-8-32 that has established a
476 coemployment relationship with another employer, pays the wages of the employees of the
477 coemployer, reserves a right of direction and control over the employees of the
478 coemployer, and assumes responsibility for the withholding and payment of payroll taxes
479 of the coemployer.
480 (b) A professional employer organization may collect information to evaluate costs; may
481 obtain life, accident and sickness, disability income, workers' compensation, and other
482 types of insurance coverage; may establish retirement plans; may have other types of
483 employee benefits; and may discuss such benefits with prospective coemployers and their
484 employees.
485 (c) A coemployer of a professional employer organization shall retain sufficient direction
486 and control over the employees involved in a coemployment relationship as is necessary
487 to conduct its business operations and fulfill its obligations to such employees. Unless
488 otherwise agreed in writing, such coemployer shall be considered to be the sole employer
489 of such employees for licensing purposes, provided that nothing contained in this Code
490 section shall be deemed to prohibit a professional employer organization and its
491 coemployer from agreeing that the professional employer organization shall be considered
492 to be an employer for licensing purposes. The professional employer organization shall
493 give written notice of such an agreement to the appropriate licensing agency and to the
494 employees involved.
495 (d) It is the intent of this Code section that professional employer organizations shall be
