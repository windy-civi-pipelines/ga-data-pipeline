Senate Resolution 283
By: Senators Beach of the 21st, Summers of the 13th, Bearden of the 30th, Williams of the
25th and Still of the 48th
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the Joint Study Committee on Height Restrictions Surrounding Georgia Airports;
2 and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only three states that does not regulate the height of structures
4 surrounding its airports, leaving a significant gap in aviation safety and infrastructure; and
5 WHEREAS, tall structures at the end of a runway or within critical approach and departure
6 zones compromise aircraft operations and public safety, forcing airports to either relocate,
7 shorten, or otherwise modify runways, which are decisions that result in substantial financial
8 cost and, in many cases, could lead to the closure of smaller, rural airports; and
9 WHEREAS, the state has a vested interest in balancing the rights of private landowners with
10 the necessity of maintaining safe and operational airports, ensuring that aviation
11 infrastructure can continue to support economic growth, public safety, and connectivity
12 across Georgia; and
13 WHEREAS, a comprehensive and strategic policy approach is needed to assess and
14 implement reasonable height restrictions that protect aviation operations while also
15 respecting the rights of property owners and fostering economic development; and

16 WHEREAS, study is needed to evaluate and recommend policies and possible legislative
17 actions that address the challenges posed by unregulated development near airports,
18 including:
19 (1) A comprehensive analysis of height restrictions in states with established policies in
20 order to identify best practices for adoption in Georgia;
21 (2) An assessment of the economic and operational impact of unregulated development
22 near airports, including the potential financial burden on airports forced to modify
23 infrastructure;
24 (3) Consideration of the legal implications of implementing height restriction regulations,
25 ensuring that any policy recommendations respect property rights while prioritizing
26 aviation safety;
27 (4) Engagement with key stakeholders, including airport operators, aviation industry
28 experts, economic development officials, and private property owners to gain a broad
29 perspective on this issue; and
30 (5) Development of legislative proposals or regulatory recommendations that strike a
31 balance between protecting Georgia's aviation infrastructure and preserving the interests
32 of private landowners.
