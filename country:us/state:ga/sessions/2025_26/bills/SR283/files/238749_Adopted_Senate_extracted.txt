Section 1:
25 LC 39 4742S (SCS)
Senate Resolution 283
25th and Still of the 48th
ADOPTED SENATE
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the Senate Height Restrictions Surrounding Georgia Airports Study Committee; and
2 for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, Georgia is one of only three states that does not regulate the height of structures
4 surrounding its airports, leaving a significant gap in aviation safety and infrastructure; and
5 WHEREAS, tall structures at the end of a runway or within critical approach and departure
6 zones compromise aircraft operations and public safety, forcing airports to either relocate,
7 shorten, or otherwise modify runways, which are decisions that result in substantial financial
8 cost and, in many cases, could lead to the closure of smaller, rural airports; and
9 WHEREAS, the state has a vested interest in balancing the rights of private landowners with
10 the necessity of maintaining safe and operational airports, ensuring that aviation
11 infrastructure can continue to support economic growth, public safety, and connectivity
12 across Georgia; and
13 WHEREAS, a comprehensive and strategic policy approach is needed to assess and
14 implement reasonable height restrictions that protect aviation operations while also
15 respecting the rights of property owners and fostering economic development; and

28 experts, economic development officials, and private property owners to gain a broad
29 perspective on this issue; and
30 (5) Development of legislative proposals or regulatory recommendations that strike a
