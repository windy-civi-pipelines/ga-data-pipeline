10 SECTION 1.
11 The General Assembly recognizes that the number of alternative fueled vehicles operating
12 on Georgia's highways continues to grow. Alternative fueled vehicles pose a unique
13 challenge to first responders, as different types of fuel can require specific safety procedures
14 in instances of an accident. Many alternative fueled vehicles are indistinguishable from
15 traditional gasoline powered vehicles. Requiring a special sticker to identify a vehicle as an
16 alternative vehicle and what type of fuel is used would assist first responders in quickly
