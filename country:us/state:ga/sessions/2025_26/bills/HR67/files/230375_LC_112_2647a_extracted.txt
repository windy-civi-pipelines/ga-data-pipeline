House Resolution 67
of the 85th, McClain of the 109th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Supporting Georgia's Clean Energy Transition, Workforce Development, and Green Job
2 Creation by 2050; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, thirteen federal agencies, including NASA, the Department of Defense, and the
4 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, contributed to the Fourth National
5 Climate Assessment, which was completed in November 2018; the report found that climate
6 change will threaten Georgia and the Southeast with increased temperatures, drought, and
7 extreme weather and that Georgia's coast will be threatened by flooding, sea-level rise, and
8 stronger and more frequent hurricanes; and
9 WHEREAS, studies completed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Risky
10 Business Project, Duke University, and others point to the severe economic costs of climate
11 change and the continued use of fossil fuels, estimating billions of dollars nationally and
12 trillions globally in costs each year; and
13 WHEREAS, communities of color and people with lower incomes in Georgia and the United
14 States are inordinately exposed to pollution from fossil fuels, including the dirtiest coal-fired
H. R. 67

25 LC 112 2647
15 power plants that produce coal ash, which disproportionately affects communities of color
16 and causes serious health problems such as cancer and asthma; and
17 WHEREAS, Georgia households with incomes below 50 percent of the federal poverty level
18 pay 41 percent of their annual income in home energy costs, and Georgia is the eighth most
19 energy-expensive state in the United States; and
20 WHEREAS, the "energy burden," or percentage of household income spent on energy bills,
21 is a crippling financial burden for families with lower incomes, and the energy burden on
22 African American and Latino households with lower incomes is up to three times as high as
23 other households; and
24 WHEREAS, transitioning to clean energy represents an unprecedented opportunity to address
25 environmental justice issues while reducing energy burdens for vulnerable populations; and
26 WHEREAS, leading economists, policy experts, and business leaders conclude that a
27 transition to a clean energy economy available for all would create millions of green jobs
28 nationally, improve our living standards, and boost economic growth in coming years; and
29 WHEREAS, Georgia's future competitiveness depends on leveraging the clean energy
30 economy to uplift employment equity and create a future where any Georgian who wants to
31 work can find a good job that pays family-supporting wages; with full employment for all,
32 Georgia could grow economic output by $12 billion every year; and

25 LC 112 2647
33 WHEREAS, investments in clean energy infrastructure, such as wind, solar, and energy
34 efficiency, provide long-term economic savings and stimulate local economies through job
35 creation and development opportunities; and
36 WHEREAS, a just transition to clean energy must include workforce development programs
37 that ensure workers in Georgia have access to the skills, training, and resources needed to fill
38 new green jobs in sectors such as renewable energy production, energy efficiency, and
39 electric vehicle infrastructure; and
40 WHEREAS, workforce development initiatives must prioritize communities
41 disproportionately impacted by climate change, pollution, and economic dislocation, ensuring
42 inclusive opportunities for education, apprenticeships, and re-skilling programs; and
43 WHEREAS, Georgia can leverage partnerships with technical colleges, universities, labor
44 unions, and industry leaders to build a pipeline of skilled workers who are prepared for the
45 demands of the clean energy economy; and
46 WHEREAS, numerous cities, including Atlanta, Savannah, and Athens; multiple universities;
47 and businesses around Georgia have adopted or are considering commitments to transition
48 to 100 percent clean and renewable energy by 2050; and
49 WHEREAS, solar energy in Georgia has seen enormous growth in the past ten years, and
50 Georgia now has more than 2,600 MW of solar capacity installed, which is enough to power
51 312,450 homes and rank Georgia as a top ten state for solar energy; and

25 LC 112 2647
52 WHEREAS, the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic include Georgia ranking
53 as second highest in the nation for the number of clean energy jobs lost, but a recovery period
54 with a clean energy focus could revitalize our economy and put Georgians back to work; and
55 WHEREAS, Georgia Power's parent company, Southern Company, has publicly committed
56 to owning a low to zero carbon generation fleet by 2050; and
57 WHEREAS, global warming is contributing to an increased incidence of extreme weather,
58 and stronger storms are already having a huge impact on Georgiaâ€”Georgia's Department
59 of Agriculture has estimated that Hurricane Michael resulted in losses totaling $3 billion in
60 2018; and
61 WHEREAS, corporate entities operating in Georgia, including Bank of America, Ikea,
62 Google, T-Mobile, and Walmart, have made commitments to purchasing 100 percent clean
63 energy on a variety of timelines; and
64 WHEREAS, adopting energy-efficient policies and incentivizing the use of electric vehicles
65 and renewable energy sources in Georgia can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions
66 while promoting innovation and technological advancements.
67 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
68 the members of this body support the transition from fossil fuels to 100 percent safe, clean,
69 renewable, and equitable energy for all energy sector economies in the State of Georgia by
70 December 31, 2050, to promote job creation, workforce development, and economic growth
71 and to protect the earth from climate catastrophe for current and future generations.
