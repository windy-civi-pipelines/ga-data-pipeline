17 Georgians by taking steps to increase access to affordable prescription drugs. In enacting
18 this Act, the legislature finds that:
19 (1) Access to prescription drugs is necessary for Georgians to maintain or acquire good
20 health;
21 (2) Excessive costs negatively impact the ability of Georgians to obtain prescription
22 drugs, and costs that exceed reasonable levels endanger the health and safety of
23 Georgians and their ability to maintain or achieve good health;
24 (3) Lack of affordability of prescription drugs threatens the economic well-being of
25 Georgians and endangers their ability to afford other necessary and essential goods and
26 services, including housing, food, and utilities;
27 (4) Excessive costs for prescription drugs contribute significantly to healthcare and
28 health insurance costs and threaten the overall ability of Georgians to obtain healthcare
29 coverage and maintain or achieve good health;
30 (5) The high cost of prescription drugs contributes significantly to rising costs to the state
31 for healthcare provided and paid for through health insurance programs for public
32 employees, including employees of the state, municipalities and counties, school districts,
33 institutions of higher education, and retirees whose healthcare costs are funded by public
34 programs, thereby threatening the ability of the state to fund those programs adequately
35 and further threatening the ability of the state to fund other programs necessary for the
36 public good, such as public education and public safety; and
37 (6) The costs to consumers, health benefit plans, and the state for prescription drug
38 coverage is higher than the costs in other countries because the prices charged by
39 manufacturers and distributors of drugs in Georgia are higher.
40 (b) Based on these findings, the legislature finds that high costs of prescription drugs
41 threaten the safety and well-being of Georgians and finds it is necessary to act in order to
42 protect Georgians from the negative impact of excessive costs for prescription drugs.

294 health condition of the individuals whom the prescription drug would benefit.
295 (f) The board shall be authorized to suspend an upper payment limit if it determines that
296 there is a shortage of the drug in this state, unless the board determines that such shortage

299 purchases of the prescription drug and reimbursements for a claim for the drug when such

312 (k) The establishment of an upper payment limit shall constitute final agency action. Any
313 person or entity may request a contested case hearing, in accordance with the procedures

315 Procedure Act,' no later than 30 days after the decision is issued. The board shall consider

322 board shall be used to reduce costs to consumers, prioritizing the reduction of out-of-pocket
323 costs for prescription drugs. No later than April 1 of each calendar year, each health

336 a manufacturer failed to provide the notice required by subsection (a) of this Code section
337 before withdrawing from sale or distribution within this state any prescription drug for
338 which the board has established an upper payment limit.
339 31-2-38.
340 All assessments, penalties, and donations and grants received by the board and any interest
341 earned on such shall be paid over into the general fund of the state treasury in accordance

House Bill 931
By: Representatives Lupton of the 83rd and Lim of the 98th
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Title 31 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to health, so as to
2 establish a framework to control the high costs of prescription drugs in this state; to provide
3 for definitions; to establish the Prescription Drug Affordability Board; to provide for such
4 board's membership, powers, duties, and meetings; to provide for assessments; to authorize
5 the board to identify certain prescription drugs for affordability review; to provide for certain
6 health benefit plans to submit information to the board; to authorize the board to conduct an
7 affordability review of certain prescription drugs; to authorize the board to establish an upper
8 payment limit on certain prescription drugs; to provide for rights of aggrieved persons; to
9 provide for the use of savings; to provide for notice requirements for a manufacturer to
10 withdraw a drug from this state; to provide for penalties; to provide for annual reports; to
11 provide for rules and regulations; to provide for programs receiving certain funds to negotiate
12 specialist rates; to provide for related matters; to provide for legislative findings; to provide
13 for an effective date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.
14 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
15 SECTION 1.
16 (a) The purpose of this Act is to protect the safety, health, and economic well-being of
H. B. 931

25 LC 52 0858
17 Georgians by taking steps to increase access to affordable prescription drugs. In enacting
18 this Act, the legislature finds that:
19 (1) Access to prescription drugs is necessary for Georgians to maintain or acquire good
20 health;
21 (2) Excessive costs negatively impact the ability of Georgians to obtain prescription
22 drugs, and costs that exceed reasonable levels endanger the health and safety of
23 Georgians and their ability to maintain or achieve good health;
24 (3) Lack of affordability of prescription drugs threatens the economic well-being of
25 Georgians and endangers their ability to afford other necessary and essential goods and
26 services, including housing, food, and utilities;
27 (4) Excessive costs for prescription drugs contribute significantly to healthcare and
28 health insurance costs and threaten the overall ability of Georgians to obtain healthcare
29 coverage and maintain or achieve good health;
30 (5) The high cost of prescription drugs contributes significantly to rising costs to the state
31 for healthcare provided and paid for through health insurance programs for public
32 employees, including employees of the state, municipalities and counties, school districts,
33 institutions of higher education, and retirees whose healthcare costs are funded by public
34 programs, thereby threatening the ability of the state to fund those programs adequately
35 and further threatening the ability of the state to fund other programs necessary for the
36 public good, such as public education and public safety; and
37 (6) The costs to consumers, health benefit plans, and the state for prescription drug
38 coverage is higher than the costs in other countries because the prices charged by
39 manufacturers and distributors of drugs in Georgia are higher.
40 (b) Based on these findings, the legislature finds that high costs of prescription drugs
41 threaten the safety and well-being of Georgians and finds it is necessary to act in order to
42 protect Georgians from the negative impact of excessive costs for prescription drugs.

271 31-2-35.
272 (a) Prior to setting any upper payment limits, the board shall establish by rule a

H. B. 931
- 11 -

25 LC 52 0858
274 (b) The board may set an upper payment limit for each prescription drug for which it
275 determines there is an affordability challenge.
276 (c) The methodology used by the board to set an upper payment limit may take into
277 consideration:
278 (1) The cost of administering the prescription drug;
279 (2) The cost of delivering the prescription drug to patients;
280 (3) The status of the prescription drug on the drug shortage list published by the United

285 prescription drug; and
286 (6) Other relevant criteria the board, accounting for any stakeholder input, determines
287 is necessary.

289 limit may help alleviate health disparities and inequitable outcomes for underserved
290 communities, people with disabilities, older adults, or any other socially, economically, or
291 environmentally disadvantaged group.
292 (e) The board shall not employ a measure or metric which assigns a reduced value to the
293 life extension provided by a prescription drug based on a pre-existing disability or chronic
294 health condition of the individuals whom the prescription drug would benefit.
295 (f) The board shall be authorized to suspend an upper payment limit if it determines that
296 there is a shortage of the drug in this state, unless the board determines that such shortage
297 was caused by a manufacturer or its agent.
298 (g) An upper payment limit for a prescription drug established by the board applies to all
299 purchases of the prescription drug and reimbursements for a claim for the drug when such
300 drug is dispensed or administered to an individual in this state in person, by mail, or by
H. B. 931
- 12 -

25 LC 52 0858
301 other means. An upper payment limit does not include a pharmacy dispensing fee, and
302 nothing in this article shall be interpreted to prevent a retail pharmacy from receiving a
303 payment that includes a dispensing fee above the upper payment limit.

305 board.
306 (i) The board shall publish a list of prescription drugs for which it has set an upper
307 payment limit.

310 limit and apply only to purchases, contracts, and plans that are issued on or renewed after
311 the effective date.
312 (k) The establishment of an upper payment limit shall constitute final agency action. Any
313 person or entity may request a contested case hearing, in accordance with the procedures
314 established for such hearings by Chapter 13 of Title 50, the 'Georgia Administrative
315 Procedure Act,' no later than 30 days after the decision is issued. The board shall consider
316 the appeal and issue a final decision concerning the appeal within 60 days after the board
317 receives the appeal. Final decisions as a result of such appeals are subject to judicial
318 review.
319 31-2-36.
320 Any savings generated by a health benefit plan, state entity, or participating ERISA plan
321 that are attributable to the implementation of an upper payment limit established by the
322 board shall be used to reduce costs to consumers, prioritizing the reduction of out-of-pocket
323 costs for prescription drugs. No later than April 1 of each calendar year, each health
324 benefit plan, state entity, and participating ERISA plan shall submit to the board, the

328 31-2-37.
329 (a) Any manufacturer that intends to withdraw from sale or distribution within this state
330 a prescription drug for which the board has established an upper payment limit shall
331 provide a notice of withdrawal in writing at least six months before the withdrawal to the
332 board, the commissioner, the Commissioner of Insurance, the Attorney General, and any
333 state entity with which the manufacturer has a contract for the sale or distribution of the
334 drug.
335 (b) The board shall assess a penalty not to exceed $500,000.00 if the board determines that
336 a manufacturer failed to provide the notice required by subsection (a) of this Code section
337 before withdrawing from sale or distribution within this state any prescription drug for
338 which the board has established an upper payment limit.
339 31-2-38.
340 All assessments, penalties, and donations and grants received by the board and any interest
341 earned on such shall be paid over into the general fund of the state treasury in accordance
342 with Code Section 45-12-92.
343 31-2-39.
344 No later than December 1, 2026, and annually thereafter, the board shall submit a report
345 to the commissioner, the Commissioner of Insurance, the Office of Health Strategy and
346 Coordination, and the chairpersons of the House Committee on Health, the House
