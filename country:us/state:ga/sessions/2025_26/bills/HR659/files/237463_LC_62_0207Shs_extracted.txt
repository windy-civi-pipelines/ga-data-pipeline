13 WHEREAS, excessive premium increases coupled with reduced coverage options create a
14 destabilized market that disproportionately harms low-income and middle-income families,
15 small businesses, and seniors on fixed incomes; and

20 rate-setting practices, profit margins, claims processing, and regulatory compliance to ensure
21 that consumers are not being subjected to unjustified rate hikes; and

24 meaningful reforms to protect consumers from predatory pricing and ensure that the
25 insurance market operates fairly and transparently.
