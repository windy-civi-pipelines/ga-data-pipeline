2 WHEREAS, the insurance market plays a crucial role in providing individuals and
3 businesses with financial protection against unforeseen risks and losses; and
4 WHEREAS, premiums across multiple lines of insurance have been steadily increasing,
5 placing an excessive and unsustainable burden on policyholders and businesses across this
6 state; and
7 WHEREAS, these increasing costs have resulted in financial hardship for consumers,
8 reducing access to essential coverage and undermining the affordability of necessary
9 protections; and
10 WHEREAS, insurance companies continue to report record profits, raising concerns about
11 the fairness and transparency of pricing models and the industry's accountability to
12 policyholders; and

13 WHEREAS, excessive premium increases coupled with reduced coverage options create a
14 destabilized market that disproportionately harms low-income and middle-income families,
15 small businesses, and seniors on fixed incomes; and
16 WHEREAS, the lack of competition in the insurance industry allows dominant providers to
17 impose unreasonable cost increases with little recourse for consumers, making regulatory
18 scrutiny a necessity; and
19 WHEREAS, it is imperative to conduct a thorough examination of the insurance industry's
20 rate-setting practices, profit margins, claims processing, and regulatory compliance to ensure
21 that consumers are not being subjected to unjustified rate hikes; and
22 WHEREAS, understanding the impact of national and state insurance regulations, as well as
23 examining successful models from other states, will enable the General Assembly to enact
24 meaningful reforms to protect consumers from predatory pricing and ensure that the
25 insurance market operates fairly and transparently.

27 (1) Creation of House study committee. There is created the House Study Committee
