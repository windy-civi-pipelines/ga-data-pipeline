3 WHEREAS, Sacred Harp singing, a moving tradition of capella shape-note harmony singing,

5 WHEREAS, the first edition of The Sacred Harp, the tunebook at the tradition's core, was

7 its publication in 1844 and has been in continuous use in the state ever since; and
8 WHEREAS, annual Sacred Harp singing conventions, many dating to the nineteenth century,
9 are still held each year in many corners of the state, forming the wellspring of a tradition that
10 has since spread across the country and abroad; and
11 WHEREAS, composers, songbook editors, and singing school teachers from Georgia such
12 as J. P. and H. S. Rees, Sarah Lancaster, A. M. Cagle, Hugh W. McGraw, and Raymond C.
13 Hamrick have composed beloved sacred songs over generations, perpetuating an
14 uninterrupted tradition of music composition in the tunebook's distinctive "dispersed
15 harmony" style; and
