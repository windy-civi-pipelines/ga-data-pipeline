16 (3) 'Mortgage trigger lead' means a consumer report obtained pursuant to
17 Section 604(c)(1)(B) of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1681b,
18 where the issuance of the report is triggered by an inquiry made with a consumer
19 reporting agency in response to an application for credit. Such term shall not include a
20 consumer report on an applicant obtained by a mortgage lender or mortgage broker with
21 which the applicant has initially applied for credit or which holds or services an existing
22 extension of credit of the applicant who is the subject of the report.
23 (b) When using a mortgage trigger lead to solicit a consumer who has applied for a loan
24 with another mortgage lender or mortgage broker, it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or
25 practice to:
26 (1) Fail to state in the initial solicitation that the person is not affiliated with the
27 mortgage lender or mortgage broker with which the consumer initially applied;
28 (2) Fail in the initial solicitation to conform to state and federal law relating to
29 prescreened solicitations using consumer reports, including the requirement to make a
30 firm offer of credit to the consumer;
31 (3) Use information regarding consumers who have opted out of the prescreened offers
32 of credit or who have placed their contact information on the federal do-not-call registry;
33 or
34 (4) Solicit a consumer with an offer of certain rates, terms, and costs with the knowledge
35 that the rates, terms, or costs will be subsequently changed to the detriment of the
36 consumer.
37 (c) Failure to comply with the provisions of this Code section shall be considered an unfair
38 or deceptive act or practice which is unlawful and shall therefore be punishable by the
39 provisions of this part."
