23 As used in this chapter, the term:
24 (1) 'Construction contractor' means any person, sole proprietor, partnership, firm,

28 (2) 'Construction project' means the providing of any labor or services, and the use of any
29 materials or equipment in order to alter, build, excavate, add to, subtract from, improve,
30 repair, maintain, renovate, move, wreck, or demolish any bridge, building, highway, road,
31 railroad, land, tunnel, sewer, drainage or other structure, project, development, or

35 composed of no more than one natural person residing in this state, whether or not
36 incorporated or employing a trade name, that is hired or retained by a hiring party to
37 provide services in exchange for an amount equal to or greater than $800.00, either by
38 itself or when aggregated with all contracts for services between the same hiring party
39 and freelance worker during the immediately preceding 120 days, but shall not include
S. B. 227
- 2 -
25 LC 52 0661
40 any person who, pursuant to the contract at issue, is a sales representative, licensed legal
41 professional, licensed medical professional, or construction contractor.
42 (4) 'Hiring party' means any person who retains a freelance worker to provide any
43 service. Such term shall not include the United States government, the state, or any
44 political subdivision thereof, or any department, agency, or instrumentality of the same.
45 34-11-3.
46 (a) When a hiring party retains the services of a freelance worker, the contract between
47 such party and worker shall be reduced to writing. The hiring party shall furnish a copy
48 of such written contract, either physically or electronically, to the freelance worker, and
49 each party to the written contract shall retain a copy thereof.
50 (b) The written contract shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
51 (1) The name and mailing address of both the hiring party and the freelance worker;
52 (2) An itemization of all services to be provided by the freelance worker, the value of the
53 services to be provided pursuant to the contract, and the rate and method of
54 compensation;
55 (3) The date on which the hiring party must pay the contracted compensation or the
56 mechanism by which such date will be determined; and
57 (4) The date by which a freelance worker must submit a list of services rendered under

59 such hiring party for the purposes of compensation being timely rendered by the
60 agreed-upon date as stipulated in paragraph (3) of this subsection.
61 (c) The Commissioner may by rule or regulation require additional terms to ensure that the
62 freelance worker and the hiring party understand their obligations under the contract.
63 (d) Such hiring party shall be required to keep such contract for a period of no less than
64 six years and shall make such contract available to the Commissioner upon request. The
65 failure of a hiring party to produce such contract, upon request of the Commissioner, shall
S. B. 227
- 3 -
25 LC 52 0661
66 give rise to a presumption that the terms that the freelance worker has presented are the
67 agreed upon terms.
68 (e) The Commissioner shall make available model contracts on the website of the
69 department for use by the general public at no cost. Such model contracts shall be made
70 available in English and in the five languages most commonly spoken by limited English

77 compensation or the mechanism by which such date will be determined, no later than 30
78 days after the completion of the freelance worker's services under the contract.
79 (b) Once a freelance worker has commenced performance of the services under the
80 contract, the hiring party shall not require as a condition of timely payment that the
81 freelance worker accept less compensation than the amount of the contracted
82 compensation.
83 34-11-5.
84 No hiring party shall threaten, intimidate, discipline, harass, deny a work opportunity to,
85 or discriminate against a freelance worker, or take any other action that penalizes a
86 freelance worker for, or is reasonably likely to deter a freelance worker from, exercising
87 or attempting to exercise any right provided for in this chapter, or from obtaining any
88 future work opportunity because the freelance worker has done so.

89 34-11-6.
90 (a) Any freelance worker or his or her authorized representative may file with the

94 department shall provide the complainant with a notice of the anticipated processing of the

102 resolution of an investigation or a complaint.
103 (c) Within 20 days of receiving the notice of complaint, the hiring party shall submit a
104 response to the Commissioner. Failure to respond to such notice within 20 days shall
105 create a rebuttable presumption in any civil action commenced in accordance with this
106 chapter that the hiring party committed the violation alleged in the complaint.
107 (d) Within 20 days of receiving written response from the hiring party, the Commissioner
108 shall send the freelance worker a copy of the hiring party's response, any accompanying
109 enclosures, and materials informing the freelance worker about the rights provided for in
110 this chapter. If the Commissioner receives no response from the hiring party, the
111 Commissioner shall mail a notice of nonresponse to both the freelance worker and the

S. B. 227
- 5 -
25 LC 52 0661
116 authorized under such Code section, shall not operate as a bar to filing of a complaint by
117 a freelance worker. In such a case, the hiring party in violation shall bear the burden of

119 the hiring party is in compliance with this chapter.
120 (f) Each freelance worker and his or her authorized representative shall be notified in

124 (a) The Commissioner shall investigate completed complaints provided for in Code
125 Section 34-11-6 and, if the Commissioner deems it necessary or advisable, shall attempt
126 to adjust equitably controversies between freelance workers and hiring parties relating to
127 this chapter.
128 (b) The Commissioner may, to the extent provided for by any reciprocal agreement entered
129 into by law or with any agency of another state, maintain actions in the courts of such other
130 state for the collection of claims and judgments for wages and may assign such claims and
131 judgments to the labor department or agency of such other state for collection to the extent
132 that such an assignment may be permitted or provided for by the law of such state or by
133 reciprocal agreement.
134 (c) The Commissioner may, upon the written consent of the labor department or other
135 corresponding agency of any other state or of any person, board, officer, or commission of
136 such state authorized to act on behalf of such labor department or corresponding agency,
137 maintain actions in the courts of this state for wages arising in such other state in the same
138 manner and to the same extent that such actions by the Commissioner are authorized when
139 arising in this state. However, such actions may be maintained only in cases where such
140 other state by law or reciprocal agreement extends a like comity to cases arising in this
141 state.

151 Commissioner. Failure to so serve a complaint shall not adversely affect any plaintiff's
152 cause of action.

154 such plaintiff requested a written contract before the contracted work began.

156 shall be awarded damages as described in this subsection and an award of reasonable

163 addition to the remedies specified in this chapter for such other violations.
164 (3) In addition to other damages awarded pursuant to this chapter, a plaintiff who
165 prevails on a claim alleging a violation of Code Section 34-11-4 shall be entitled to an

175 action on behalf of the state in a court of competent jurisdiction.
176 (2) An action pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be commenced by filing

180 (A) A person alleging a violation of this chapter from filing a civil action based on the

192 (b) The provisions of this chapter supplement and do not diminish or replace any other
193 basis of liability or requirement established by statute or common law.
194 (c) Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall not render any contract

198 34-11-11.
199 The department shall conduct a public awareness outreach campaign, which shall include

202 through phone and email.
203 34-11-12.
204 (a) No later than six months after the Commissioner sends to a freelance worker either a
205 hiring party's response and accompanying materials or a notice of nonresponse, the

207 about the resolution of the freelance worker's claims. Such survey shall ask whether or not
208 the freelance worker pursued any such claims in court or through an alternative dispute
209 resolution process and whether or not the hiring party ultimately paid any or all of the
210 compensation the freelance worker alleged was due or if the matter was resolved in a

138 manner and to the same extent that such actions by the Commissioner are authorized when
139 arising in this state. However, such actions may be maintained only in cases where such
140 other state by law or reciprocal agreement extends a like comity to cases arising in this
