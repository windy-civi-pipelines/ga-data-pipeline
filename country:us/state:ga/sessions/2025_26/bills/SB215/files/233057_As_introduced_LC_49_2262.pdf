16 (1) The First Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment,
17 forbids abridgment of the freedom of speech; that freedom of speech includes both the
18 right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all; and that the right to
19 eschew association for expressive purposes is likewise protected, as freedom of
20 association plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate;
21 (2) Forced associations that burden protected speech are impermissible, as is compelling
22 one person to subsidize the speech of another; and
23 (3) States and public sector unions that extract agency fees from nonconsenting members
24 violate the First Amendment.
25 (b) It is the General Assembly's intent that individuals who are licensed to practice law in
26 this state shall not be required to be members of any bar association or other organization for
27 which they are required to pay license fees that may be used to advocate for public policies
28 espoused by such bar association or other organization for any purpose other than:
29 (1) Adopting rules and regulations governing the practice of law in this state and
30 defining the rights, duties, and obligations of individuals licensed to practice law in this
31 state;
32 (2) The examination of individuals applying for a license to practice law in this state;
33 (3) The admission of qualified applicants to the practice of law in this state;
34 (4) Enforcing the ethical rules governing individuals licensed to practice law in this state;
35 (5) Regulating the mandate of continuing legal education for individuals licensed to
36 practice law in this state; and
37 (6) Pursuing those who engage in the unauthorized practice of law in this state.
