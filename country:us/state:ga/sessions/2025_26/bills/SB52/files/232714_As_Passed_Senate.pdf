15 SECTION 1.
16 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Timberlands Recovery, Exemption, and
17 Earnings Stability (TREES) Act."
18 SECTION 2.
19 The General Assembly finds that:
20 (1) Hurricane Helene has had a catastrophic impact on the citizens and the economy of
21 many areas in this state, has particularly devastated the timber industry on which the
22 citizens of southwest Georgia are heavily dependent for their livelihood by reducing or
23 eliminating the long-held investments in standing timber and timberlands of businesses and
24 families, and has created both a public fire hazard and a danger of insect infestations due
25 to the massive amounts of downed timber caused by the severity of this natural disaster;
26 (2) As of November, 2024, the estimated losses to standing timber caused by Hurricane
27 Helene as measured by the Georgia Forestry Commission were nearly $1.3 billion;
28 (3) Timberlands as investments are unique as an agriculture product in this state, as timber
29 products often take ten years or longer to realize any return on the investment;
30 (4) Many counties, municipalities, and local school districts rely on the taxes levied at the
31 time of timber's harvest or sale pursuant to Code Section 48-5-7.5, but with the destruction
32 of timberlands throughout this state, that tax revenue will likely not be realized; and
33 (5) It is the intent of the General Assembly to authorize local governing authorities to
34 provide temporary tax relief from the taxes levied pursuant to Code 48-5-7.5 so that the
35 timber industry, and the businesses and families that provide timber products to such
36 industry, will realize a reduced cost for growing new product and recovering from the
37 devastating effects of Hurricane Helene. These reduced costs will help stabilize the market
38 and allow for quicker harvesting and recovery of lands where some timber is still
39 salvageable.
