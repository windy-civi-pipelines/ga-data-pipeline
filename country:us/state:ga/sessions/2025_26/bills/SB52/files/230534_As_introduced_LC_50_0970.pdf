15 SECTION 2.
16 The General Assembly finds that:
17 (1) Hurricane Helene has had a catastrophic impact on the citizens and the economy of
18 many areas in this state, has particularly devastated the timber industry on which the
19 citizens of southwest Georgia are heavily dependent for their livelihood by reducing or
20 eliminating the long-held investments in standing timber and timberlands of businesses and
21 families, and has created both a public fire hazard and a danger of insect infestations due
22 to the massive amounts of downed timber caused by the severity of this natural disaster;
23 (2) As of November, 2024, the estimated losses to standing timber caused by Hurricane
24 Helene as measured by the Georgia Forestry Commission were nearly $1.3 billion;
25 (3) Timberlands as investments are unique as an agriculture product in this state, as timber
26 products often take ten years or longer to realize any return on the investment;
27 (4) Many counties, municipalities, and local school districts rely on the taxes levied at the
28 time of timber's harvest or sale pursuant to Code Section 48-5-7.5, but with the destruction
29 of timberlands throughout this state, that tax revenue will likely not be realized; and
30 (5) It is the intent of the General Assembly to authorize local governing authorities to
31 provide temporary tax relief from the taxes levied pursuant to Code 48-5-7.5 so that the
32 timber industry, and the businesses and families that provide timber products to such
33 industry, will realize a reduced cost for growing new product and recovering from the
34 devastating effects of Hurricane Helene. These reduced costs will help stabilize the market
35 and allow for quicker harvesting and recovery of lands where some timber is still
36 salvageable.
37 SECTION 3.
38 Chapter 5 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to ad valorem
39 taxation of property, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
