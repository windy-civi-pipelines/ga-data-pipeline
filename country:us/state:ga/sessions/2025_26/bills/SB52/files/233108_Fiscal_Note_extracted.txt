SUBJECT: Fiscal Note
Dear Chairman Hufstetler:
This bill would provide temporary tax relief on standing timber in FEMA-declared disaster counties
due to Hurricane Helene. Local governments could choose to not collect timber taxes for the
entirety of 2025 and refund any timber taxes collected in the last quarter of 2024. The state would
offset the revenue losses through grants to participating local governments. These grants will be
administered by the Georgia Department of Revenue (DOR), with the amounts determined in
consultation with the governing authorities and the Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC). GFC is
directed to determine damage criteria, to develop and provide taxpayer certification forms, and to
audit property for compliance upon request of eligible governing authorities. No grant amount can
exceed the average of the total timber revenue received by a governing authority in years 2021
through 2023.
Data from DOR indicates that the bill would increase state expenditures by a maximum of $17.3
million.1 This maximum total is based on the three-year historic average timber revenues for each
impacted county. The actual reduction in local tax revenue (and the state grant total) will likely be
lower as some portion of timber in these counties will not be deemed eligible for tax relief. GFC
would also incur an estimated $23,000 in administrative costs, while DOR would be able to
implement provisions of the bill with existing resources.
Estimated costs of the bill used the assumptions below.
• In all 93 affected counties, all local governments qualified to participate in the tax relief on
timber elect to do so.
• Lines 42-44 of the bill mentions a disaster area designated for “public assistance or
individual and public assistance.” We assume this language excludes counties labeled as “no
designation” and “individual assistance” on FEMA’s Georgia Declaration map as of
November 4, 2024.
• There will be 300 landowners who require an audit by GFC.
1 The Department of Community Affairs separately estimated local governing authority revenue losses from participation
at $7.9 million. This amount is based on an assumption that a constant share of the total assessed value of timber in each
county is severely damaged (30.3%).

• GFC audit site visits will average one hour in length per visit at an average cost of $41.77 per
hour. This amounts to $12,531 for 300 visits.
• GFC site visits will have a 50-mile average round trip length using the closest foresters in the
vicinity. At $0.70 per mile for 300 trips, this amounts to $10,500.
• DCA assumes the assessed value of severely damaged timber is 30.3% of the total assessed
value of timber for all affected counties. This share comes from ratio of the value of severely
damaged timber to the value of total timber damage from the November 5, 2024, Hurricane
Helene Timber Damage Assessment published by GFC.
An additional factor that could result in lower participation by local governments is that the tax
relief could incentivize larger timber harvests than usual in 2025, resulting in larger local
government revenue losses relative to grant amounts. This possibility could lower the cost to the
state.
