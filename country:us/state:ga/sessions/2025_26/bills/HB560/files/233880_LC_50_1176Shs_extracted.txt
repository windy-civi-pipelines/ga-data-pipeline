145 which each municipality that levies an ad valorem tax on property shall receive, which
146 percentage shall not be less than that proportion which each such absent municipality's
147 population bears to the total population of all municipalities that levy ad valorem taxes
148 on property within the special district multiplied by that portion of the remaining
149 proceeds which are received by all such municipalities within the special district. No

186 authorized tax shall not be imposed until the expiration of the tax then in effect."

193 "48-8-89.
194 (a) The proceeds of the tax collected by the commissioner in each special district under
195 this article shall be disbursed as soon as practicable after collection as follows:
196 (1) One percent of the amount collected shall be paid into the general fund of the state
197 treasury in order to defray the costs of administration; and
198 (2) Except for the percentage provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the remaining
199 proceeds of the tax shall be distributed to the governing authority of each qualified
200 municipality within the special district and to the governing authority of the county
201 whose geographical boundary is conterminous with that of the special district for the
202 purpose of assisting such political subdivisions in funding all or any portion of those
203 services which are to be provided by such governing authorities pursuant to and in
204 accordance with Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III of the Constitution of this state.
205 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that no agreement as to the distribution of the
206 proceeds of the tax shall enrich any political subdivision beyond a sum which in the
207 absence of the distribution would be raised through other sources of revenue. The
208 distribution shall be in accordance with a certificate which shall be executed in behalf of
209 each respective governing authority, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, and
210 which shall encompass all respective political subdivisions, shall be filed with the
211 commissioner, and shall specify by percentage that portion of the remaining proceeds of
212 the tax available for distribution which each such political subdivision shall receive. On
213 or after July 1, 1995, the distribution of proceeds of the tax as specified in the certificate
214 shall be based upon, but not be limited to, the following criteria:
215 (1) The service delivery responsibilities of each political subdivision to the population
216 served by the political jurisdiction and served during normal business hours, conventions,
217 trade shows, athletic events and the inherent value to a community of a central business
218 district and the unincorporated areas of the county and the obligation of all residents of

- 9 -
25 LC 50 1176S
219 the county for the maintenance and prosperity of the central business district and the
220 unincorporated areas of the county;
221 (2) The service delivery responsibilities of each political subdivision to the resident
222 population of the subdivision;
223 (3) The existing service delivery responsibility of each political subdivision;
224 (4) The effect of a change in sales tax distribution on the ability of each political
225 subdivision to meet its short-term and long-term debt;
226 (5) The point of sale and use which generates the tax to be apportioned;
227 (6) The existence of intergovernmental agreements among and between the political
228 subdivisions;
229 (7) The use by any political subdivision of property taxes and other revenues from some
230 taxpayers to subsidize the cost of services provided to other taxpayers of the levying
231 subdivision; and
232 (8) Any coordinated plan of county and municipal service delivery and financing.
233 Notwithstanding the fact that a certificate shall not contain an execution in behalf of one
234 or more qualified municipalities within the special district or an execution of the county
235 whose boundaries are conterminous with that of the special district, if the combined total
236 of the populations of all such absent municipalities political subdivisions is less than
237 one-half of the aggregate population of all qualified municipalities located within the
238 special district, the submitting political subdivisions shall, in behalf of the absent
239 municipalities political subdivisions, specify a percentage of that portion of the remaining
240 proceeds which each such municipality or county shall receive, which percentage shall not
241 be less than that proportion which each absent municipality's population or absent county's
242 unincorporated population bears to the total population of all qualified municipalities
243 within the special district multiplied by that portion of the remaining proceeds which are
244 received by all qualified municipalities political subdivisions within the special district.
245 For the purpose of determining the population of the absent municipalities, only that
H. B. 560 (SUB)
- 10 -
25 LC 50 1176S
246 portion of the population of each such municipality which is located within the special
247 district shall be computed. No certificate may contain a total of specified percentages in
248 excess of 100 percent. The certificate shall be filed with the commissioner by March 1,
249 1980, for those special districts in which the tax authorized by this article is being levied
250 on January 1, 1980. For all other special districts in which the tax shall be imposed
251 subsequent to January 1, 1980, the certificate shall be filed with the commissioner within
252 60 days after the tax is imposed within the district. The commissioner shall continue to
253 distribute the proceeds of the tax as otherwise provided in this Code section until the first
254 day of the next calendar year following the month in which the commissioner receives a
255 certificate as provided in this Code section, which certificate shall provide other
256 percentages upon which the commissioner shall make the distribution to the political
257 subdivisions entitled to the proceeds of the tax. At such time, the commissioner shall
258 thereafter distribute the proceeds of the tax in accordance with the directions of the
259 certificate.
260 (c) If the certificate provided for in subsection (b) of this Code section is not received by
261 the commissioner by the required date, the authority to impose the tax authorized by Code
262 Section 48-8-82 shall cease on the first day of the second calendar month following the
263 month in which the tax was initially imposed and the tax shall not be levied in the special
264 district after such date unless the reimposition of the tax is subsequently authorized
265 pursuant to Code Section 48-8-85. When the imposition of the tax is so terminated, the
266 commissioner shall retain the proceeds of the tax which were to be distributed to the
267 governing authorities of the county and qualified municipalities within the special district
268 until he or she receives a certificate in behalf of each such governing authority specifying
269 the percentage of the proceeds which each such governing authority shall receive. If no
270 such certificate is received by the commissioner within 120 days of the date on which the
271 authority to levy the tax was terminated, the proceeds shall escheat to the state and the
272 commissioner shall transfer the proceeds to the state's general fund.

273 (d)(1) A certificate providing for the distribution of the proceeds of the tax authorized
274 by this article shall expire on December 31 of the second year following the year in which
275 the decennial census is conducted. No later than December 30 of the second year
276 following the year in which the census is conducted, a new distribution certificate
277 meeting the requirements for certificates specified by subsection (b) of this Code section
278 shall be filed with and received by the commissioner. The General Assembly recognizes
279 that the requirement for government services is not always in direct correlation with
280 population. Although a new distribution certificate is required within a time certain of
281 the decennial census, this requirement is not meant to convey an intent by the General
282 Assembly that population as a criterion should be more heavily weighted than other
283 criteria. It is the express intent of the General Assembly in requiring such renegotiation
284 that eligible political subdivisions shall analyze local service delivery responsibilities and
285 the existing allocation of proceeds made available to such governments under the
286 provisions of this article and make rational the allocation of such resources to meet such
287 service delivery responsibilities. Political subdivisions in their renegotiation of such
288 distributions shall at a minimum consider the criteria specified in subsection (b) of this
289 Code section.
290 (2) The commissioner shall be notified in writing of the commencement of renegotiation
291 proceedings by the county governing authority on behalf of all eligible political
292 subdivisions within the special district. The eligible political subdivisions shall
293 commence renegotiations at the call of the county governing authority before July 1 of
294 the second year following the year in which the census is conducted. If the county
295 governing authority does not issue the call by that date, any eligible municipality may
296 issue the call and so notify the commissioner and all eligible political subdivisions within
297 the special district.
298 (3) Following the commencement of such renegotiation, if the parties necessary to an
299 agreement fail to reach an agreement within 60 days, such parties shall submit the dispute
H. B. 560 (SUB)
- 12 -
25 LC 50 1176S
300 to nonbinding arbitration, mediation, or such other means of resolving conflicts in a
301 manner which attempts to reach a resolution of the dispute. Any renegotiation agreement
302 reached pursuant to this paragraph shall be in accordance with the requirements specified
303 in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
304 (4) Reserved.
305 (5) If a new distribution certificate as provided for in this Code section is not received
306 by the commissioner, the authority to impose the tax authorized by Code Section 48-8-82
307 shall cease, and the tax shall not be levied in the special district after such date unless the
308 reimposition of the tax is subsequently authorized pursuant to Code Section 48-8-85.
309 When the imposition of the tax is so terminated, the commissioner shall retain the
310 proceeds of the tax which were to be distributed to the governing authorities of the county
311 and qualified municipalities within the special district until the commissioner receives a
312 certificate on behalf of each such governing authority specifying the percentage of the
313 proceeds which each such governing authority shall receive. If no such certificate is
314 received by the commissioner within 120 days of the date on which the authority to levy
315 the tax was terminated, the proceeds shall escheat to the state, and the commissioner shall
316 transfer the proceeds to the state's general fund.
317 (6) If the commissioner receives a new distribution certificate by the required date, the
318 commissioner shall distribute the proceeds of the tax in accordance with the directions
319 of the new distribution certificate commencing on January 1 of the year immediately
320 following the year in which such certificate was executed by the parties or the judge or
321 the first day of the second calendar month following the month such certificate was
322 executed by the parties or the judge, whichever is sooner.
323 (7) Costs of any conflict resolution under paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection shall be
324 borne proportionately by the affected political subdivisions in accordance with the final
325 percentage distributions of the proceeds of the tax as reflected by the new distribution
326 certificate.
H. B. 560 (SUB)
- 13 -
25 LC 50 1176S
327 (8) Political subdivisions shall be authorized, at their option, to renegotiate distribution
328 certificates on a more frequent basis than is otherwise required under this subsection.
329 (9) No provision of this subsection shall apply to any county which is authorized to levy
330 or which levies a local sales tax, local use tax, or local sales and use tax for educational
331 purposes pursuant to a local constitutional amendment or to any county which is
332 authorized to expend all or any portion of the proceeds of any sales tax, use tax, or sales
333 and use tax for educational purposes pursuant to a local constitutional amendment."
334 SECTION 3-2.
335 Said chapter is further amended in said article by revising subsection (c) of Code Section
336 48-8-89.1, relating to procedure for certifying additional qualified municipalities, issuance
337 of new distribution certificate, and cessation of authority to collect tax, as follows:
338 "(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a distribution certificate required by
339 this Code section must be executed by the governing authorities of the county within which
340 the special district is located and each qualified municipality located wholly or partially
341 within the special district, including the new qualified municipality. Notwithstanding the
342 fact that a certificate shall not contain an execution in behalf of the county within which
343 the special district is located or one or more qualified municipalities within the special
344 district, if the combined total of the populations of all such absent municipalities and the
345 absent county's unincorporated population is less than one-half of the aggregate population
346 of all qualified municipalities located within the special district, the submitting political
347 subdivisions shall, in behalf of the absent municipalities political subdivisions, specify a
348 percentage of that portion of the remaining proceeds which each such municipality political
349 subdivision shall receive, which percentage shall not be less than that proportion which
350 each absent municipality's and any absent county's unincorporated population bears to the
351 total population of all qualified municipalities within the special district multiplied by that
352 portion of the remaining proceeds which are received by all qualified municipalities
H. B. 560 (SUB)
- 14 -
25 LC 50 1176S
353 political subdivisions within the special district. For the purpose of determining the
354 population of the absent municipalities, only that portion of the population of each such
355 municipality which is located within the special district shall be computed."
356 SECTION 3-3.
357 Said chapter is further amended in said article by adding a new subsection to Code Section
358 48-8-91, relating to condition precedent to authority to impose tax after first year, annual

143 authorities entering into the such intergovernmental agreement shall, on in behalf of such
144 absent municipalities, specify a percentage of that portion of the remaining proceeds

25 LC 50 1176S
145 which each municipality that levies an ad valorem tax on property shall receive, which
146 percentage shall not be less than that proportion which each such absent municipality's
147 population bears to the total population of all municipalities that levy ad valorem taxes
148 on property within the special district multiplied by that portion of the remaining
149 proceeds which are received by all such municipalities within the special district. No
150 portion of the tax shall be apportioned to counties and or municipalities that do not levy

152 adjusted base year value homestead exemption in effect.
153 (3)(f) Subject to the limitation provided for in Code Section 48-8-6, any special district
154 which wholly or partially contains a jurisdiction levying the tax provided for under

178 shall be forwarded to the commissioner to ensure it is received within five business days
179 after certification of the election results."
180 "(c) For any special district in which a tax authorized by this article is in effect may, while
181 such tax is in effect, the General Assembly may pass a local Act calling for a reimposition
182 of a tax as authorized by this article upon the termination of the tax then in effect, and a
183 referendum may be held for this purpose while the tax is in effect. Proceedings for such

186 authorized tax shall not be imposed until the expiration of the tax then in effect."
187 PART III
188 SECTION 3-1.
189 Said chapter is further amended in Article 2, relating to joint county and municipal sales and
190 use tax (LOST), by revising Code Section 48-8-89, relating to distribution and use of
191 proceeds, negotiated certificate of distribution for political subdivisions, absent
192 municipalities, filing of certificates, and renegotiations, as follows:
H. B. 560 (SUB)
- 8 -

25 LC 50 1176S
193 "48-8-89.
194 (a) The proceeds of the tax collected by the commissioner in each special district under
195 this article shall be disbursed as soon as practicable after collection as follows:
196 (1) One percent of the amount collected shall be paid into the general fund of the state
197 treasury in order to defray the costs of administration; and
198 (2) Except for the percentage provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the remaining
199 proceeds of the tax shall be distributed to the governing authority of each qualified
200 municipality within the special district and to the governing authority of the county
201 whose geographical boundary is conterminous with that of the special district for the
202 purpose of assisting such political subdivisions in funding all or any portion of those
203 services which are to be provided by such governing authorities pursuant to and in
204 accordance with Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III of the Constitution of this state.
205 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that no agreement as to the distribution of the
206 proceeds of the tax shall enrich any political subdivision beyond a sum which in the
207 absence of the distribution would be raised through other sources of revenue. The
208 distribution shall be in accordance with a certificate which shall be executed in behalf of
209 each respective governing authority, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, and
210 which shall encompass all respective political subdivisions, shall be filed with the
211 commissioner, and shall specify by percentage that portion of the remaining proceeds of
212 the tax available for distribution which each such political subdivision shall receive. On
213 or after July 1, 1995, the distribution of proceeds of the tax as specified in the certificate
214 shall be based upon, but not be limited to, the following criteria:
215 (1) The service delivery responsibilities of each political subdivision to the population
216 served by the political jurisdiction and served during normal business hours, conventions,
217 trade shows, athletic events and the inherent value to a community of a central business
218 district and the unincorporated areas of the county and the obligation of all residents of
H. B. 560 (SUB)
- 9 -

25 LC 50 1176S
219 the county for the maintenance and prosperity of the central business district and the
220 unincorporated areas of the county;
221 (2) The service delivery responsibilities of each political subdivision to the resident
222 population of the subdivision;
223 (3) The existing service delivery responsibility of each political subdivision;
224 (4) The effect of a change in sales tax distribution on the ability of each political
225 subdivision to meet its short-term and long-term debt;
226 (5) The point of sale and use which generates the tax to be apportioned;
227 (6) The existence of intergovernmental agreements among and between the political
228 subdivisions;
229 (7) The use by any political subdivision of property taxes and other revenues from some
230 taxpayers to subsidize the cost of services provided to other taxpayers of the levying
231 subdivision; and
232 (8) Any coordinated plan of county and municipal service delivery and financing.
233 Notwithstanding the fact that a certificate shall not contain an execution in behalf of one
234 or more qualified municipalities within the special district or an execution of the county
235 whose boundaries are conterminous with that of the special district, if the combined total
236 of the populations of all such absent municipalities political subdivisions is less than
237 one-half of the aggregate population of all qualified municipalities located within the
238 special district, the submitting political subdivisions shall, in behalf of the absent
239 municipalities political subdivisions, specify a percentage of that portion of the remaining
240 proceeds which each such municipality or county shall receive, which percentage shall not
241 be less than that proportion which each absent municipality's population or absent county's
242 unincorporated population bears to the total population of all qualified municipalities
243 within the special district multiplied by that portion of the remaining proceeds which are
244 received by all qualified municipalities political subdivisions within the special district.
245 For the purpose of determining the population of the absent municipalities, only that
H. B. 560 (SUB)
- 10 -

25 LC 50 1176S
246 portion of the population of each such municipality which is located within the special
247 district shall be computed. No certificate may contain a total of specified percentages in
248 excess of 100 percent. The certificate shall be filed with the commissioner by March 1,
249 1980, for those special districts in which the tax authorized by this article is being levied
250 on January 1, 1980. For all other special districts in which the tax shall be imposed
251 subsequent to January 1, 1980, the certificate shall be filed with the commissioner within
252 60 days after the tax is imposed within the district. The commissioner shall continue to
253 distribute the proceeds of the tax as otherwise provided in this Code section until the first
254 day of the next calendar year following the month in which the commissioner receives a
255 certificate as provided in this Code section, which certificate shall provide other
256 percentages upon which the commissioner shall make the distribution to the political
257 subdivisions entitled to the proceeds of the tax. At such time, the commissioner shall
258 thereafter distribute the proceeds of the tax in accordance with the directions of the
259 certificate.
260 (c) If the certificate provided for in subsection (b) of this Code section is not received by
261 the commissioner by the required date, the authority to impose the tax authorized by Code
262 Section 48-8-82 shall cease on the first day of the second calendar month following the
263 month in which the tax was initially imposed and the tax shall not be levied in the special
264 district after such date unless the reimposition of the tax is subsequently authorized
265 pursuant to Code Section 48-8-85. When the imposition of the tax is so terminated, the
266 commissioner shall retain the proceeds of the tax which were to be distributed to the
267 governing authorities of the county and qualified municipalities within the special district
268 until he or she receives a certificate in behalf of each such governing authority specifying
269 the percentage of the proceeds which each such governing authority shall receive. If no
270 such certificate is received by the commissioner within 120 days of the date on which the
271 authority to levy the tax was terminated, the proceeds shall escheat to the state and the
272 commissioner shall transfer the proceeds to the state's general fund.

273 (d)(1) A certificate providing for the distribution of the proceeds of the tax authorized
274 by this article shall expire on December 31 of the second year following the year in which
275 the decennial census is conducted. No later than December 30 of the second year
276 following the year in which the census is conducted, a new distribution certificate
277 meeting the requirements for certificates specified by subsection (b) of this Code section
278 shall be filed with and received by the commissioner. The General Assembly recognizes
279 that the requirement for government services is not always in direct correlation with
280 population. Although a new distribution certificate is required within a time certain of
281 the decennial census, this requirement is not meant to convey an intent by the General
282 Assembly that population as a criterion should be more heavily weighted than other
283 criteria. It is the express intent of the General Assembly in requiring such renegotiation
284 that eligible political subdivisions shall analyze local service delivery responsibilities and
285 the existing allocation of proceeds made available to such governments under the
286 provisions of this article and make rational the allocation of such resources to meet such
287 service delivery responsibilities. Political subdivisions in their renegotiation of such
288 distributions shall at a minimum consider the criteria specified in subsection (b) of this
289 Code section.
290 (2) The commissioner shall be notified in writing of the commencement of renegotiation
291 proceedings by the county governing authority on behalf of all eligible political
292 subdivisions within the special district. The eligible political subdivisions shall
293 commence renegotiations at the call of the county governing authority before July 1 of
294 the second year following the year in which the census is conducted. If the county
295 governing authority does not issue the call by that date, any eligible municipality may
296 issue the call and so notify the commissioner and all eligible political subdivisions within
297 the special district.
298 (3) Following the commencement of such renegotiation, if the parties necessary to an
299 agreement fail to reach an agreement within 60 days, such parties shall submit the dispute

300 to nonbinding arbitration, mediation, or such other means of resolving conflicts in a
301 manner which attempts to reach a resolution of the dispute. Any renegotiation agreement
302 reached pursuant to this paragraph shall be in accordance with the requirements specified
303 in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
304 (4) Reserved.
305 (5) If a new distribution certificate as provided for in this Code section is not received
306 by the commissioner, the authority to impose the tax authorized by Code Section 48-8-82
307 shall cease, and the tax shall not be levied in the special district after such date unless the
308 reimposition of the tax is subsequently authorized pursuant to Code Section 48-8-85.
309 When the imposition of the tax is so terminated, the commissioner shall retain the
310 proceeds of the tax which were to be distributed to the governing authorities of the county
311 and qualified municipalities within the special district until the commissioner receives a
312 certificate on behalf of each such governing authority specifying the percentage of the
313 proceeds which each such governing authority shall receive. If no such certificate is
314 received by the commissioner within 120 days of the date on which the authority to levy
315 the tax was terminated, the proceeds shall escheat to the state, and the commissioner shall
316 transfer the proceeds to the state's general fund.
317 (6) If the commissioner receives a new distribution certificate by the required date, the
318 commissioner shall distribute the proceeds of the tax in accordance with the directions
319 of the new distribution certificate commencing on January 1 of the year immediately
320 following the year in which such certificate was executed by the parties or the judge or
321 the first day of the second calendar month following the month such certificate was
322 executed by the parties or the judge, whichever is sooner.
323 (7) Costs of any conflict resolution under paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection shall be
324 borne proportionately by the affected political subdivisions in accordance with the final
325 percentage distributions of the proceeds of the tax as reflected by the new distribution
326 certificate.

327 (8) Political subdivisions shall be authorized, at their option, to renegotiate distribution
328 certificates on a more frequent basis than is otherwise required under this subsection.
329 (9) No provision of this subsection shall apply to any county which is authorized to levy
330 or which levies a local sales tax, local use tax, or local sales and use tax for educational
331 purposes pursuant to a local constitutional amendment or to any county which is
332 authorized to expend all or any portion of the proceeds of any sales tax, use tax, or sales
333 and use tax for educational purposes pursuant to a local constitutional amendment."
334 SECTION 3-2.
335 Said chapter is further amended in said article by revising subsection (c) of Code Section
336 48-8-89.1, relating to procedure for certifying additional qualified municipalities, issuance
337 of new distribution certificate, and cessation of authority to collect tax, as follows:
338 "(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a distribution certificate required by
339 this Code section must be executed by the governing authorities of the county within which
340 the special district is located and each qualified municipality located wholly or partially
341 within the special district, including the new qualified municipality. Notwithstanding the
342 fact that a certificate shall not contain an execution in behalf of the county within which
343 the special district is located or one or more qualified municipalities within the special
344 district, if the combined total of the populations of all such absent municipalities and the
345 absent county's unincorporated population is less than one-half of the aggregate population
346 of all qualified municipalities located within the special district, the submitting political
347 subdivisions shall, in behalf of the absent municipalities political subdivisions, specify a
348 percentage of that portion of the remaining proceeds which each such municipality political
349 subdivision shall receive, which percentage shall not be less than that proportion which
350 each absent municipality's and any absent county's unincorporated population bears to the
351 total population of all qualified municipalities within the special district multiplied by that
352 portion of the remaining proceeds which are received by all qualified municipalities

353 political subdivisions within the special district. For the purpose of determining the
354 population of the absent municipalities, only that portion of the population of each such
355 municipality which is located within the special district shall be computed."
356 SECTION 3-3.
357 Said chapter is further amended in said article by adding a new subsection to Code Section
358 48-8-91, relating to condition precedent to authority to impose tax after first year, annual
359 adjustment of millage rate formula, and information required on tax bills, to read as follows:
360 "(c) This Code section shall not be applicable to the county whose geographical boundary
361 is conterminous with that of the special district for any period of time that such county is
362 treated as an absent county under Code Section 48-8-89 or 48-8-89.1."
363 PART IV
364 SECTION 4-1.
365 Part III of this Act shall only apply with respect to distribution certificates entered into on or
366 after January 1, 2028.
