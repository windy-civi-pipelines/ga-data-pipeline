25 LC 56 0394
35 51-17-3.
36 (a) The protections provided for in Code Section 51-17-2 shall be deemed exclusive to the

44 exclusive right to nonsexual use of an individual's indicia of identity is terminated by
45 proof of the nonuse of the indicia of identity of any individual for commercial purposes

61 solicitation of donations, purchases of products, merchandise, goods, or services, selling
62 such indicia of identity, or integrating indicia of identify into machine learning training
63 with knowledge that use of such indicia of identity was not authorized by the individual,
64 executor or administrator, heirs, or devisees, or in the case of a minor, the minor's parent
65 or legal guardian;
66 (2) Publishes, performs, distributes, transmits, sells, or otherwise makes available to the
67 public an individual's indicia of identity, with knowledge that use of such indicia of

70 (3) Makes available an algorithm, software, tool, or other technology, service, or device,
71 where a purpose or function of such algorithm, software, tool, or other technology,
72 service, or device is the production of a particular, identifiable individual's voice or
73 likeness, with knowledge that distributing, transmitting, or otherwise making available
74 the voice or likeness was not authorized by the individual, executor or administrator,
75 heirs, or devisees, or in the case of a minor, the minor's parent or legal guardian.
76 51-17-5.
77 (a) In any cause of action pursuant to this chapter, an individual shall be entitled to recover
78 the greater of $1,000.00 or actual damages suffered. Such individual shall also be entitled
79 to recover any profits that are attributable to such appropriation which are not taken into
80 account in computing the actual damages. Profit or lack thereof from the appropriation or
81 infringement of an individual's rights shall not be a criterion of determining liability.
82 (b) The court having jurisdiction for any action arising pursuant to this chapter may grant
83 injunctions on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain the
84 appropriation of an individual's indicia of identity.

25 LC 56 0394
85 51-17-6.
86 (a) The use of an individual's indicia of identity in a commercial medium shall not
87 automatically constitute unlawful appropriation solely because the material containing such
88 use is commercially sponsored or contains paid advertising. Any determination of whether
89 such use was for the purpose of advertising or solicitation shall consider whether or not the
90 use of the individual's indicia of identity was so directly connected with the commercial
91 sponsorship or with the paid advertising as to constitute a but-for cause of any such
92 advertising or sponsorship.
93 (b) Nothing in this chapter shall impose liability for the documentation of an individual's
94 presence in places where an individual does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
95 51-17-7.
96 (a) Nothing in this chapter shall apply to activities protected by the First Amendment to
97 the United States Constitution, including, but not limited to, satire, parody, works of artistic
98 expression, or works of journalism by bona fide news organizations.
99 (b) Nothing in this chapter shall apply to the owners or employees of any medium used for
100 advertising, including, but not limited to, newspapers, magazines, radio and television
101 stations, billboards, and transit advertisements, who have published or disseminated any
102 advertisement or solicitation in violation of this chapter, unless it is established that such
103 owners or employees had knowledge or reasonably should have known of the appropriation
104 of the individual's indicia of identity as prohibited by this chapter.
105 (c) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impose a duty upon a provider of an
106 interactive computer service, as defined in Section 230 of Title 47 of the United States
107 Code, to review or enforce compliance with this chapter by third-party content providers."
108 SECTION 2.
109 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
