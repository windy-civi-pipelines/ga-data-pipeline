17 (b) Each resident of Columbia County is granted an exemption on such person's homestead
18 from Columbia County ad valorem taxes for county purposes in the amount of $8,000.00 of
19 the assessed value of that homestead. The value of such property in excess of such exempted
20 amount shall remain subject to taxation.
21 (c) A person shall not receive the homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this
22 section unless such person or person's agent files an application with the tax commissioner
23 of Columbia County, giving such information relative to receiving such exemption as will
24 enable the tax commissioner of Columbia County to make a determination regarding the
25 initial and continuing eligibility of such person for such exemption. The tax commissioner
26 of Columbia County shall provide application forms for this purpose.
27 (d) The exemption shall be claimed and returned as provided in Code Section 48-5-50.1 of
28 the O.C.G.A., as amended. The exemption shall be automatically renewed from year to year
29 so long as the person granted the homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this section
30 occupies such residence as a homestead. After a person has filed the proper application as
31 provided in subsection (c) of this section, it shall not be necessary to make application
32 thereafter for any year, and the exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It
33 shall be the duty of any person granted the homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this
34 section to notify the tax commissioner of Columbia County in the event that such person for
35 any reason becomes ineligible for such exemption.
36 (e) The exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to or affect any
37 state ad valorem taxes, county or independent school district ad valorem taxes for educational
38 purposes, or municipal ad valorem taxes for municipal purposes. The homestead exemption
39 granted by subsection (b) of this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other
40 homestead exemption applicable to Columbia County ad valorem taxes for county purposes;
41 provided, however, that the exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall be
42 reduced by the amount of the assessed value of the homestead that is exempt pursuant to
43 Code Section 48-5-44 of the O.C.G.A.
