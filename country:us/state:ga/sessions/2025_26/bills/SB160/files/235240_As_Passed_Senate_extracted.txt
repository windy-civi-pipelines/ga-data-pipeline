19 as a component of a motor vehicle that controls or affects the speed of a motor vehicle.

23 forfeiture, order the title to the vehicle transferred to such other family member who is
24 a duly licensed operator and who requires the use of such vehicle for employment or
25 family transportation purposes. Such transfer shall be subject to any valid liens and shall
26 be granted only once Upon a second or subsequent conviction of a violation of this Code

28 assistance device upon the motor vehicle operated by the offender during such violation

30 of the Department of Revenue. Such order shall set the maximum speed limit for an
31 intelligent speed assistance device installed upon a motor vehicle at a speed limit of no
32 greater than 70 miles per hour. An intelligent speed assistance device shall be installed
33 within ten days of the issuance of such order and remain on the vehicle for a period of
34 time ordered by the court which shall be no less than three months. The costs relating to
35 the installation of an intelligent speed assistance device upon a motor vehicle and any
36 monitoring thereof shall be borne by the offender. Any court which orders an intelligent
37 speed assistance device to be placed upon a motor vehicle pursuant to this subsection
38 shall provide the Department of Revenue with a copy of such order. The records of the
39 Department of Revenue shall contain a record reflecting that the motor vehicle shall only
40 be operated when equipped with a functioning intelligent speed assistance device. The
41 operation of a motor vehicle without an intelligent speed assistance device for which an
42 order for installation of an intelligent speed assistance device has been issued pursuant
43 to this subsection by the offender issued such order shall be punished as for a
44 misdemeanor."
