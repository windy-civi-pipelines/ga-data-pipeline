177 (2) Upon conviction of a violation of this Code section and in addition to the punishment
178 provided for in subsection (a) of this Code section, a court shall be authorized to order
179 the installation of an intelligent speed assistance device upon the motor vehicle operated
180 by the offender during such violation when the offender is the registered owner of such
181 motor vehicle as shown in the records of the Department of Revenue. Such order shall
182 set the maximum speed limit for an intelligent speed assistance device installed upon a
183 motor vehicle at a speed limit of no greater than 20 percent above the posted speed limit.
184 An intelligent speed assistance device shall be installed within ten days of the issuance
185 of such order and remain on the vehicle for a period of time ordered by the court which
186 shall be no less than six months. The costs relating to the installation of an intelligent
187 speed assistance device upon a motor vehicle and any monitoring thereof shall be borne
188 by the offender. Any court which orders an intelligent speed assistance device to be
189 placed upon a motor vehicle pursuant to this subsection shall provide the Department of
190 Revenue with a copy of such order. The records of the Department of Revenue shall
191 contain a record reflecting that the motor vehicle shall only be operated when equipped

193 without an intelligent speed assistance device for which an order for installation of an
194 intelligent speed assistance device has been issued pursuant to this subsection by the
195 offender issued such order shall be punished as for a misdemeanor."
196 SECTION 6.
