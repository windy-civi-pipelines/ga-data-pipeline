16 Jewish victims of the Holocaust and the millions of other victims of Nazi persecution; and
17 WHEREAS, January 27, 2025, marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz,

21 including Birkenau, a killing center where over a million victims were systematically
22 murdered by individuals and professionals involved in its operation; and

24 arrived at Auschwitz, where its leadership and workers conducted these systematic killings
25 over nearly five years; and
26 WHEREAS, in mid-January 1945, as Soviet forces approached Auschwitz, SS units forcibly
