240 SECTION 8.
241 Revenue bonds; conditions precedent to issuance.
242 The Authority shall adopt a resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds. In the

254 evidencing the obligations which constitute the security therefor shall constitute a debt or a
255 loan or pledge of the faith and credit of the State of Georgia or of any political subdivision

258 authorizing or securing the issuance and payment of such bonds or notes. The issuance of
259 such bonds or notes shall not obligate the State or any political subdivision thereof, other
260 than the Authority, nor shall any such bond or note constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance,
261 legal or equitable, upon any such property. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, this
262 Act shall not affect the ability of the Authority and a political subdivision or municipal
263 corporation of the State from entering into an intergovernmental contract pursuant to which
S. B. 206
- 11 -
25 LC 47 3300
264 the political subdivision or municipal corporation agrees to pay amounts sufficient to pay
265 operating charges and other costs of the Authority or any project, including, without
266 limitation, the principal of and interest on revenue bonds, in consideration for services or
267 facilities of the Authority.
268 SECTION 10.
269 Revenue bonds; trust indenture as security.
270 In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust
271 agreement or indenture made by the Authority with a corporate trustee which may be any
272 trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State.
273 Such trust agreement or indenture may pledge or assign all revenues, receipts, and earnings
274 to be received by the Authority and any proceeds which may be derived from the disposition
275 of any real or personal property of the Authority or proceeds of insurance carried thereon.
276 The resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds and such trust agreement or
277 indenture may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the
278 bond owners, including the right of appointment of a receiver upon default in the payment
279 of any principal or interest obligation and the right of any receiver or trustee to enforce
280 collection of contractual rights, rates, fees, tolls, charges, or revenues for the use of the
281 services or facilities of the project necessary to pay all costs of operation and all reserves
282 provided for, the principal of and interest on all bonds in the issue, all costs of collection, and
283 all other costs reasonably necessary to accomplish the collection of such sums in the event
284 of any default of the Authority. Such resolution and trust agreement or indenture may
285 include covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of
286 property for and construction of the project and to the custody, safeguarding, and application
287 of all funds of the Authority, including any proceeds derived from the disposition of any real
288 or personal property of the Authority or proceeds of insurance carried thereon, and covenants
S. B. 206
- 12 -
25 LC 47 3300
289 providing for the operation, maintenance, repair, and insurance of the project and may
290 contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional bonds may be
291 issued. Such resolution and trust agreement or indenture may set forth the rights and
292 remedies of the bond owners and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action
293 of any bond owner as is customary in securing bonds and debentures of corporations and
294 may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the
295 security of the bond owners. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust may be treated
296 as part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such trust.
297 SECTION 11.
298 Revenue bonds; interest rate or rates; negotiability; exemption from taxes.
299 All revenue bonds shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents
300 of negotiable instruments under the laws of the State. The interest rate or rates to be borne
301 by any revenue bonds or other obligations of the Authority shall be fixed by the board of the
302 Authority. Any limitations with respect to interest rates found in Article 3 of Chapter 82 of
303 Title 36 of the O.C.G.A. or the usury laws of this State shall not apply to revenue bonds
304 issued under this Act. All revenue bonds, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall be
305 exempt from all taxation within the State.
306 SECTION 12.
307 Trust indenture as security; remedies of bondholders.
308 Any owner of revenue bonds and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the
309 extent that the rights given herein may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance
310 of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action,
311 mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights it may have under
S. B. 206

312 the laws of the State, including specifically, but without limitation, the Revenue Bond Law,

319 To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid.
320 In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the
321 Authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue bonds to
322 any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee
323 of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such
324 regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.
325 SECTION 14.
326 Sinking fund.
327 All or any part of the gross or net revenues and earnings derived from any particular project
328 or projects and any and all revenues and earnings received by the Authority, regardless of
329 whether or not such revenues and earnings were produced by a particular project for which
330 bonds have been issued, may be pledged by the Authority to the payment of the principal of
331 and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as may be provided in any resolution
332 authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in any trust instrument pertaining to such bonds.
333 Such funds so pledged, from whatever source received, may include funds received from one
334 or more or all sources and may be set aside at regular intervals into a sinking fund for which
S. B. 206
- 14 -
25 LC 47 3300
335 provision may be made in any such resolution or trust instrument, which sinking funds may
336 be pledged to and charged with the payment of:
337 (1) The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall become due;
338 (2) The principal of the bonds as the same shall mature;
339 (3) The necessary charges of any trustee or paying agent or registrar for such bonds; and
340 (4) Any premium upon bonds retired upon call or purchase.
341 The use and disposition of any sinking fund may be subject to such regulations for which
342 provisions may be made in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust
343 instrument or indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust
344 instrument or indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the
345 benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another.
346 SECTION 15.
347 Interest of bondholders protected.
348 While any of the bonds or notes issued by the Authority shall remain outstanding, the
349 powers, duties, or existence of the Authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not
350 be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights
351 of the owners of such bonds or notes; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority
352 shall be created to compete with the Authority so as to affect adversely the interests and
353 rights of the owners of such bonds or notes. The provisions of this Act shall be for the
354 benefit of the Authority and every owner of the Authority's bonds and notes and, upon and
355 after the issuance of bonds or notes under the provisions of this Act, shall constitute an
356 irrevocable contract by the Authority with the owners of such bonds and notes.
