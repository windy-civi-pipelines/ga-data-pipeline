298 in Chapter 2, relating to persons and their rights, by adding a new Code section to read as
299 follows:
300 "1-2-7.1.
301 (a) The General Assembly finds the following with respect to the application of an
302 individual's sex pursuant to any state law or rules and regulations:
303 (1) The term 'sex' refers to an individual's biological sex, either male or female. An
304 individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth and in no case is
305 an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification;
306 (2) With respect to sex, the term 'equal' does not mean same or identical;
307 (3) With respect to sex, separate accommodations are not inherently unequal;

312 (5) Laws, rules, and regulations that distinguish between the sexes are subject to
313 intermediate constitutional scrutiny. Intermediate constitutional scrutiny forbids unfair
314 discrimination against similarly situated male and female individuals but allows the law
H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 13 -
25 LC 49 2282S
315 to distinguish between the sexes where such distinctions are substantially related to
316 important governmental objections; and

318 sexes with respect to athletics, living facilities, locker rooms, domestic violence shelters,
319 rape crisis centers, restrooms, and other areas where biology, safety, or privacy are
320 implicated that result in separate accommodations are substantially related to the
321 important governmental objections of protecting the health, safety, and privacy of
322 individuals in such circumstances.
323 (b) Any local school system, public school, or any state agency, department, or political
324 subdivision that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with
325 antidiscrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering accurate public health, crime,
326 economic, or other data shall identify each individual who is part of the collected data set

330 generally, by revising paragraphs (4) through (6) of subsection (d) as follows:

335 is expressly excluded.

345 capable of the generation, migration, and utilization of sperm for fertilization, or would
346 have such capabilities but for a developmental or genetic anomaly or historical accident.

357 forms so adopted may be altered locally in a particular petition or proceeding in such items
358 as grammar, gender usage sex terminology, the use of singular and plural nouns and

392 Said title is further amended in Code Section 17-10-17, relating to sentencing of defendants
393 guilty of crimes involving bias or prejudice and identification of increased sentence, by
394 revising subsection (b) as follows:
395 "(b) Subject to the notice requirement provided in Code Section 17-10-18 and in

398 property as the object of the offense because of such victim's or group of victims' actual or
399 perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental
400 disability, or physical disability, the judge imposing sentence shall:
401 (1) If the offense for which the defendant was convicted is a designated misdemeanor,
402 impose a sentence of imprisonment for a period of not less than six nor more than 12
403 months, and a fine not to exceed $5,000.00; or
404 (2) If the offense for which the defendant was convicted is a felony, impose a sentence

407 SECTION 5-4.
408 Title 20 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to education, is amended in
409 Code Section 20-2-315, relating to gender discrimination prohibited, authorized separate
410 gender teams, equal athletic opportunity, physical education classes, employee designated
411 to monitor compliance, grievance procedures, and reporting requirements, by revising
412 subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (j) as follows:
H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 17 -
25 LC 49 2282S
413 "(a) No student shall, on the basis of gender sex, be excluded from participation in, be
414 denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another student, or otherwise be
415 discriminated against in any interscholastic or intramural athletics offered by a local school
416 system, and no local school system shall provide any such athletics separately on such
417 basis.
418 (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (a) of this Code section, a local school
419 system may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each gender sex where
420 selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact
421 sport. However, where a local school system operates or sponsors a team in a particular
422 sport for members of one gender sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members
423 of the other gender sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that gender sex in that
424 particular sport have previously been limited, members of the excluded gender sex must
425 be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.
426 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system
427 to operate or sponsor a single team for a contact sport that includes members of both
428 genders sexes. As used in this subsection, the term 'contact sport' includes boxing,
429 wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and any other sport the purpose or major
430 activity of which involves bodily contact.
431 (c) A local school system which operates or sponsors interscholastic or intramural athletics
432 shall undertake all reasonable efforts to provide equal athletic opportunity for members of
433 both genders sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available the following
434 factors shall be considered:
435 (1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate
436 the interests and abilities of members of both genders sexes;
437 (2) The provision of equipment and supplies;
438 (3) Scheduling of games and practice time;
439 (4) Travel allowance;
H. B. 267 (SUB)

25 LC 49 2282S
440 (5) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
441 (6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
442 (7) Provision of locker rooms and practice and competitive facilities;
443 (8) Provision of medical and training facilities and services; and
444 (9) Publicity.
445 Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each gender sex or unequal expenditures
446 for male and female teams if a local school system operates or sponsors separate teams will
447 not constitute noncompliance with this subsection, but the failure to provide essential funds
448 for the basic operations of teams for one gender sex may be considered in assessing
449 equality of opportunity for members of each gender sex. Nothing in Code Section
450 20-2-411 shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system to expend school
451 tax funds as authorized by Article VIII, Section VI, Paragraph I(b) of the Constitution in
452 order to comply with the requirements of this Code section.
453 (d) A local school system may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities
454 on the basis of gender sex, but such facilities shall be comparable to such facilities
455 provided for students of the other gender sex.
456 (e) This Code section does not prohibit the grouping of students in physical education
457 classes by gender sex."
458 "(j) The Department of Education may publish an annual report of local school systems
459 to include information regarding expenditures and participation rates for each gender sex
460 and such other information as the state board and department deem relevant."
461 SECTION 5-5.
462 Title 40 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to motor vehicles and traffic, is
463 amended in Code Section 40-5-25, relating to applications, fees, provisions for voluntary
464 participation in various programs, by revising subsection (d) as follows:
H. B. 267 (SUB)

465 "(d)(1) The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of this state to encourage
466 improved public education and awareness regarding anatomical gifts of human organs
467 and tissues and to address the ever increasing need for donations of anatomical gifts for
468 the benefit of the citizens of Georgia.
469 (2) The department shall make available to procurement organizations or secure data
470 centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement organization
471 information provided for in Article 6 of Chapter 5 of Title 44, the 'Georgia Revised
472 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,' including the name, license number, date of birth, gender
473 sex, and most recent address of any person eligible pursuant to Code Section 44-5-142
474 who obtains an organ donor driver's license; provided, however, that the gender
475 information sex category information of either male or female shall be made available
476 only to a procurement organization or secure data center if such organization or center
477 has sufficient funds to cover the associated costs of providing such information.
478 Information so obtained by such organizations and centers shall be used for a state-wide
479 organ donor registry accessible to organ tissue and eye banks authorized to function as
480 such in this state and shall not be further disseminated."
481 SECTION 5-6.
482 Said title is further amended in Code Section 40-5-100, relating to personal identification
483 cards, contents, possession of more than one card prohibited, and optional contributions to
484 and participation in voluntary programs, by revising paragraph (2) of subsection (e) as
485 follows:
486 "(2) The department shall make available to procurement organizations or secure data
487 centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement organization
488 information provided for in Article 6 of Chapter 5 of Title 44, the 'Georgia Revised
489 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,' including the name, identification card number, date of
490 birth, gender sex, and most recent address of any person who obtains an organ donor
H. B. 267 (SUB)

25 LC 49 2282S
491 identification card; provided, however, that the gender information with respect to one's
492 sex shall be made available only to a procurement organization or secure data center if
493 such organization or center has sufficient funds to cover the associated costs of providing
494 such information. Information so obtained by such organizations and centers shall be
495 used for a state-wide organ donor registry accessible to organ tissue and eye banks
496 authorized to function as such in this state and shall not be further disseminated."
497 SECTION 5-7.
498 Title 44 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to property, is amended in Code
499 Section 44-5-158, relating to donor registry, by revising subsection (a) as follows:
500 "(a) The Department of Driver Services shall make available to procurement organizations
501 or secure data centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement
502 organization the name, license number, date of birth, gender sex, and most recent address
503 of any person who obtains an organ donor's license; provided, however, that the gender
504 information with respect to one's sex shall only be made available to a procurement
505 organization or secure data center if such organization or center has sufficient funds to
506 cover the associated costs with providing such information. Information so obtained by
507 such organizations shall be used for the purpose of establishing a state-wide organ donor
508 registry accessible to organ tissue and eye banks authorized to function as such in this state
509 and shall not be further disseminated."
510 SECTION 5-8.
511 Title 49 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to social services, is amended
512 in Article 1 of Chapter 5 of Title 49, relating to children and youth services, by revising Code
513 Section 49-5-22, relating to voluntary pre-kindergarten programs to provide toilet facilities
514 screened for privacy, as follows:
H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 21 -
25 LC 49 2282S
515 "49-5-22.
516 (a) The General Assembly finds that just as gender separated toileting separated by one's
517 sex among nonrelatives is the norm among adults, children should be allowed the same
518 opportunity to practice modesty when independent toileting behavior is well established
519 among the majority of their age group. Standardized adherence to this policy would
520 provide privacy, injury control, and sanitation.
521 (b) Each public or private voluntary pre-kindergarten program in this state which receives
522 state funding shall provide toilet facilities for the four-year-old pre-kindergarten age
523 children which it serves which are suitably screened for privacy. Nothing contained in this
524 Code section shall be construed to require a pre-kindergarten program to provide separately
525 constructed toilet facilities.
526 (c) The provisions of subsection (b) of this Code section shall not apply to any voluntary
527 pre-kindergarten program which provides separate and gender-specific male and female
528 toilet facilities for the children which it serves."
529 SECTION 5-9.

531 in Code Section 50-12-22, relating to membership, appointment, terms, chairperson, and

533 "(2) The council should be a balanced representation of the entire state, accounting for,
534 but not limited to, minority and ethnic groups, gender male and female diversity,
535 geographic diversity, large and small organizations, and the public and private sectors;"
536 SECTION 5-10.
537 Various titles of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated are amended by replacing "gender"
538 with "sex" wherever the former term appears in:

303 (1) The term 'sex' refers to an individual's biological sex, either male or female. An
304 individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth and in no case is

318 sexes with respect to athletics, living facilities, locker rooms, domestic violence shelters,

322 individuals in such circumstances.
323 (b) Any local school system, public school, or any state agency, department, or political
324 subdivision that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with

422 sport for members of one gender sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members
423 of the other gender sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that gender sex in that
424 particular sport have previously been limited, members of the excluded gender sex must

433 both genders sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available the following
434 factors shall be considered:
435 (1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate

441 (6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
442 (7) Provision of locker rooms and practice and competitive facilities;

444 (9) Publicity.
445 Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each gender sex or unequal expenditures
446 for male and female teams if a local school system operates or sponsors separate teams will
447 not constitute noncompliance with this subsection, but the failure to provide essential funds
448 for the basic operations of teams for one gender sex may be considered in assessing
449 equality of opportunity for members of each gender sex. Nothing in Code Section
450 20-2-411 shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system to expend school
451 tax funds as authorized by Article VIII, Section VI, Paragraph I(b) of the Constitution in
452 order to comply with the requirements of this Code section.
453 (d) A local school system may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities
454 on the basis of gender sex, but such facilities shall be comparable to such facilities
455 provided for students of the other gender sex.
456 (e) This Code section does not prohibit the grouping of students in physical education
457 classes by gender sex."
458 "(j) The Department of Education may publish an annual report of local school systems
459 to include information regarding expenditures and participation rates for each gender sex
460 and such other information as the state board and department deem relevant."

H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 21 -

25 LC 49 2282S
515 "49-5-22.
516 (a) The General Assembly finds that just as gender separated toileting separated by one's
517 sex among nonrelatives is the norm among adults, children should be allowed the same
518 opportunity to practice modesty when independent toileting behavior is well established
519 among the majority of their age group. Standardized adherence to this policy would
520 provide privacy, injury control, and sanitation.
521 (b) Each public or private voluntary pre-kindergarten program in this state which receives
522 state funding shall provide toilet facilities for the four-year-old pre-kindergarten age
523 children which it serves which are suitably screened for privacy. Nothing contained in this
524 Code section shall be construed to require a pre-kindergarten program to provide separately
525 constructed toilet facilities.
526 (c) The provisions of subsection (b) of this Code section shall not apply to any voluntary
527 pre-kindergarten program which provides separate and gender-specific male and female
528 toilet facilities for the children which it serves."
