298 in Chapter 2, relating to persons and their rights, by adding a new Code section to read as
299 follows:
300 "1-2-7.1.
301 (a) The General Assembly finds the following with respect to the application of an
302 individual's sex pursuant to any state law or rules and regulations:
303 (1) The term 'sex' refers to an individual's biological sex, either male or female. An
304 individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth and in no case is
305 an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification;
306 (2) With respect to sex, the term 'equal' does not mean same or identical;
307 (3) With respect to sex, separate accommodations are not inherently unequal;
308 (4) An individual born with a medically verifiable diagnosis of disorder or differences
309 in sex development shall be provided any available legal protections and
310 accommodations afforded under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,
311 42 U.S.C. Section 12101 et seq., and any applicable state law;
312 (5) Laws, rules, and regulations that distinguish between the sexes are subject to
313 intermediate constitutional scrutiny. Intermediate constitutional scrutiny forbids unfair
314 discrimination against similarly situated male and female individuals but allows the law
H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 13 -
25 LC 49 2300S
315 to distinguish between the sexes where such distinctions are substantially related to
316 important governmental objections; and
317 (6) Notwithstanding any provision of state law to the contrary, distinctions between the
318 sexes with respect to athletics, living facilities, locker rooms, domestic violence shelters,
319 rape crisis centers, restrooms, and other areas where biology, safety, or privacy are
320 implicated that result in separate accommodations are substantially related to the
321 important governmental objections of protecting the health, safety, and privacy of
322 individuals in such circumstances.
323 (b) Any local school system, public school, or any state agency, department, or political
324 subdivision that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with
325 antidiscrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering accurate public health, crime,
326 economic, or other data shall identify each individual who is part of the collected data set
327 as either male or female at birth."

329 Said title is further amended in Code Section 1-3-1, relating to construction of statutes
330 generally, by revising paragraphs (4) through (6) of subsection (d) as follows:
331 "(4) Gender. The masculine gender includes the feminine and the neuter.
332 (5)(4) Joint authority. A joint authority given to any number of persons or officers may
333 be executed by a majority of them, unless it is otherwise declared.

335 is expressly excluded.

345 capable of the generation, migration, and utilization of sperm for fertilization, or would
346 have such capabilities but for a developmental or genetic anomaly or historical accident.

355 subsection (b) as follows:
356 "(b) The rules adopted pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section shall provide that the
357 forms so adopted may be altered locally in a particular petition or proceeding in such items
358 as grammar, gender usage sex terminology, the use of singular and plural nouns and
359 pronouns, the omission of optional or alternate language, the inclusion of variable

366 "(a) Whenever a law enforcement officer investigates an incident of a crime in which it
367 appears there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the defendant intentionally selected
368 any victim or group of victims or any property as the object of the offense because of such
369 victim's or group of victims' actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex,
370 sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability, whether or not an arrest
371 is made, the officer shall prepare and submit to the law enforcement officer's supervisor or

380 "(a) No student shall, on the basis of gender sex, be excluded from participation in, be
381 denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another student, or otherwise be
382 discriminated against in any interscholastic or intramural athletics offered by a local school
383 system, and no local school system shall provide any such athletics separately on such
384 basis.
385 (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (a) of this Code section, a local school
386 system may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each gender sex where
H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 16 -
25 LC 49 2300S
387 selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact
388 sport. However, where a local school system operates or sponsors a team in a particular
389 sport for members of one gender sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members
390 of the other gender sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that gender sex in that
391 particular sport have previously been limited, members of the excluded gender sex must
392 be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.
393 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system
394 to operate or sponsor a single team for a contact sport that includes members of both
395 genders sexes. As used in this subsection, the term 'contact sport' includes boxing,
396 wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and any other sport the purpose or major
397 activity of which involves bodily contact.
398 (c) A local school system which operates or sponsors interscholastic or intramural athletics
399 shall undertake all reasonable efforts to provide equal athletic opportunity for members of
400 both genders sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available the following
401 factors shall be considered:
402 (1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate
403 the interests and abilities of members of both genders sexes;
404 (2) The provision of equipment and supplies;
405 (3) Scheduling of games and practice time;
406 (4) Travel allowance;
407 (5) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
408 (6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
409 (7) Provision of locker rooms and practice and competitive facilities;
410 (8) Provision of medical and training facilities and services; and
411 (9) Publicity.
412 Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each gender sex or unequal expenditures
413 for male and female teams if a local school system operates or sponsors separate teams will
H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 17 -
25 LC 49 2300S
414 not constitute noncompliance with this subsection, but the failure to provide essential funds
415 for the basic operations of teams for one gender sex may be considered in assessing
416 equality of opportunity for members of each gender sex. Nothing in Code Section
417 20-2-411 shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system to expend school
418 tax funds as authorized by Article VIII, Section VI, Paragraph I(b) of the Constitution in
419 order to comply with the requirements of this Code section.
420 (d) A local school system may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities
421 on the basis of gender sex, but such facilities shall be comparable to such facilities
422 provided for students of the other gender sex.
423 (e) This Code section does not prohibit the grouping of students in physical education
424 classes by gender sex."
425 "(j) The Department of Education may publish an annual report of local school systems
426 to include information regarding expenditures and participation rates for each gender sex
427 and such other information as the state board and department deem relevant."
428 SECTION 5-4.

430 amended in Code Section 40-5-25, relating to applications, fees, provisions for voluntary

433 improved public education and awareness regarding anatomical gifts of human organs
434 and tissues and to address the ever increasing need for donations of anatomical gifts for
435 the benefit of the citizens of Georgia.
436 (2) The department shall make available to procurement organizations or secure data
437 centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement organization

439 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,' including the name, license number, date of birth, gender

447 such in this state and shall not be further disseminated."
448 SECTION 5-5.

453 "(2) The department shall make available to procurement organizations or secure data
454 centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement organization
455 information provided for in Article 6 of Chapter 5 of Title 44, the 'Georgia Revised
456 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,' including the name, identification card number, date of
457 birth, gender sex, and most recent address of any person who obtains an organ donor
458 identification card; provided, however, that the gender information with respect to one's
459 sex shall be made available only to a procurement organization or secure data center if
460 such organization or center has sufficient funds to cover the associated costs of providing
461 such information. Information so obtained by such organizations and centers shall be
462 used for a state-wide organ donor registry accessible to organ tissue and eye banks
463 authorized to function as such in this state and shall not be further disseminated."

479 in Article 1 of Chapter 5 of Title 49, relating to children and youth services, by revising Code
480 Section 49-5-22, relating to voluntary pre-kindergarten programs to provide toilet facilities
481 screened for privacy, as follows:
482 "49-5-22.
483 (a) The General Assembly finds that just as gender separated toileting separated by one's
484 sex among nonrelatives is the norm among adults, children should be allowed the same
485 opportunity to practice modesty when independent toileting behavior is well established
486 among the majority of their age group. Standardized adherence to this policy would
487 provide privacy, injury control, and sanitation.
488 (b) Each public or private voluntary pre-kindergarten program in this state which receives
489 state funding shall provide toilet facilities for the four-year-old pre-kindergarten age
H. B. 267 (SUB)

491 Code section shall be construed to require a pre-kindergarten program to provide separately
492 constructed toilet facilities.
493 (c) The provisions of subsection (b) of this Code section shall not apply to any voluntary
494 pre-kindergarten program which provides separate and gender-specific male and female
495 toilet facilities for the children which it serves."

296 SECTION 4-1.
297 Title 1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to general provisions, is amended
298 in Chapter 2, relating to persons and their rights, by adding a new Code section to read as
299 follows:
300 "1-2-7.1.
301 (a) The General Assembly finds the following with respect to the application of an
302 individual's sex pursuant to any state law or rules and regulations:
303 (1) The term 'sex' refers to an individual's biological sex, either male or female. An
304 individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth and in no case is
305 an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification;
306 (2) With respect to sex, the term 'equal' does not mean same or identical;
307 (3) With respect to sex, separate accommodations are not inherently unequal;
308 (4) An individual born with a medically verifiable diagnosis of disorder or differences
309 in sex development shall be provided any available legal protections and
310 accommodations afforded under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,
311 42 U.S.C. Section 12101 et seq., and any applicable state law;
312 (5) Laws, rules, and regulations that distinguish between the sexes are subject to
313 intermediate constitutional scrutiny. Intermediate constitutional scrutiny forbids unfair
314 discrimination against similarly situated male and female individuals but allows the law
H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 13 -

25 LC 49 2300S
315 to distinguish between the sexes where such distinctions are substantially related to
316 important governmental objections; and
317 (6) Notwithstanding any provision of state law to the contrary, distinctions between the
318 sexes with respect to athletics, living facilities, locker rooms, domestic violence shelters,
319 rape crisis centers, restrooms, and other areas where biology, safety, or privacy are
320 implicated that result in separate accommodations are substantially related to the
321 important governmental objections of protecting the health, safety, and privacy of
322 individuals in such circumstances.
323 (b) Any local school system, public school, or any state agency, department, or political
324 subdivision that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with
325 antidiscrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering accurate public health, crime,
326 economic, or other data shall identify each individual who is part of the collected data set
327 as either male or female at birth."
328 SECTION 4-2.
329 Said title is further amended in Code Section 1-3-1, relating to construction of statutes
330 generally, by revising paragraphs (4) through (6) of subsection (d) as follows:
331 "(4) Gender. The masculine gender includes the feminine and the neuter.

342 capable of the generation, migration, and utilization of eggs for fertilization, or would
343 have such capabilities but for a developmental or genetic anomaly or historical accident."
344 "(9.1) 'Male' means an individual who has, had, or will have the reproductive system
345 capable of the generation, migration, and utilization of sperm for fertilization, or would
346 have such capabilities but for a developmental or genetic anomaly or historical accident.
347 (9.2) 'Man' means, except when used as a generic reference to human beings, an adult
348 human male."
349 "(11.1) 'Mother' means a parent of the female sex."

354 Section 15-9-90, relating to forms for probate court and local alteration, by revising
355 subsection (b) as follows:
356 "(b) The rules adopted pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section shall provide that the
357 forms so adopted may be altered locally in a particular petition or proceeding in such items
358 as grammar, gender usage sex terminology, the use of singular and plural nouns and
359 pronouns, the omission of optional or alternate language, the inclusion of variable

363 amended in Code Section 17-4-20.2, relating to bias crime report, requirements, use of
364 reports, and publication, by revising the introductory paragraph of subsection (a) through
365 "Investigation," as follows:
366 "(a) Whenever a law enforcement officer investigates an incident of a crime in which it
367 appears there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the defendant intentionally selected
368 any victim or group of victims or any property as the object of the offense because of such
369 victim's or group of victims' actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex,
370 sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability, whether or not an arrest
371 is made, the officer shall prepare and submit to the law enforcement officer's supervisor or
372 other designated person a written report of the incident entitled 'Bias Crime Report.' Forms
373 for such reports shall be designed and provided by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation."
374 SECTION 5-3.
375 Title 20 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to education, is amended in
376 Code Section 20-2-315, relating to gender discrimination prohibited, authorized separate
377 gender teams, equal athletic opportunity, physical education classes, employee designated
378 to monitor compliance, grievance procedures, and reporting requirements, by revising
379 subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (j) as follows:
380 "(a) No student shall, on the basis of gender sex, be excluded from participation in, be
381 denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another student, or otherwise be
382 discriminated against in any interscholastic or intramural athletics offered by a local school
383 system, and no local school system shall provide any such athletics separately on such
384 basis.
385 (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (a) of this Code section, a local school
386 system may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each gender sex where
H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 16 -

25 LC 49 2300S
387 selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact
388 sport. However, where a local school system operates or sponsors a team in a particular
389 sport for members of one gender sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members
390 of the other gender sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that gender sex in that
391 particular sport have previously been limited, members of the excluded gender sex must
392 be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.
393 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system
394 to operate or sponsor a single team for a contact sport that includes members of both
395 genders sexes. As used in this subsection, the term 'contact sport' includes boxing,
396 wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and any other sport the purpose or major
397 activity of which involves bodily contact.
398 (c) A local school system which operates or sponsors interscholastic or intramural athletics
399 shall undertake all reasonable efforts to provide equal athletic opportunity for members of
400 both genders sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available the following
401 factors shall be considered:
402 (1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate
403 the interests and abilities of members of both genders sexes;
404 (2) The provision of equipment and supplies;
405 (3) Scheduling of games and practice time;
406 (4) Travel allowance;
407 (5) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
408 (6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
409 (7) Provision of locker rooms and practice and competitive facilities;
410 (8) Provision of medical and training facilities and services; and
411 (9) Publicity.
412 Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each gender sex or unequal expenditures
413 for male and female teams if a local school system operates or sponsors separate teams will
H. B. 267 (SUB)
- 17 -

25 LC 49 2300S
414 not constitute noncompliance with this subsection, but the failure to provide essential funds
415 for the basic operations of teams for one gender sex may be considered in assessing
416 equality of opportunity for members of each gender sex. Nothing in Code Section
417 20-2-411 shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system to expend school
418 tax funds as authorized by Article VIII, Section VI, Paragraph I(b) of the Constitution in
419 order to comply with the requirements of this Code section.
420 (d) A local school system may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities
421 on the basis of gender sex, but such facilities shall be comparable to such facilities
422 provided for students of the other gender sex.
423 (e) This Code section does not prohibit the grouping of students in physical education
424 classes by gender sex."
425 "(j) The Department of Education may publish an annual report of local school systems
426 to include information regarding expenditures and participation rates for each gender sex
427 and such other information as the state board and department deem relevant."
428 SECTION 5-4.
429 Title 40 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to motor vehicles and traffic, is
430 amended in Code Section 40-5-25, relating to applications, fees, provisions for voluntary
431 participation in various programs, by revising subsection (d) as follows:
432 "(d)(1) The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of this state to encourage
433 improved public education and awareness regarding anatomical gifts of human organs
434 and tissues and to address the ever increasing need for donations of anatomical gifts for
435 the benefit of the citizens of Georgia.
436 (2) The department shall make available to procurement organizations or secure data
437 centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement organization
438 information provided for in Article 6 of Chapter 5 of Title 44, the 'Georgia Revised
439 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,' including the name, license number, date of birth, gender

443 only to a procurement organization or secure data center if such organization or center
444 has sufficient funds to cover the associated costs of providing such information.
445 Information so obtained by such organizations and centers shall be used for a state-wide
446 organ donor registry accessible to organ tissue and eye banks authorized to function as
447 such in this state and shall not be further disseminated."

449 Said title is further amended in Code Section 40-5-100, relating to personal identification
450 cards, contents, possession of more than one card prohibited, and optional contributions to

454 centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement organization
455 information provided for in Article 6 of Chapter 5 of Title 44, the 'Georgia Revised
456 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,' including the name, identification card number, date of
457 birth, gender sex, and most recent address of any person who obtains an organ donor
458 identification card; provided, however, that the gender information with respect to one's
459 sex shall be made available only to a procurement organization or secure data center if
460 such organization or center has sufficient funds to cover the associated costs of providing
461 such information. Information so obtained by such organizations and centers shall be
462 used for a state-wide organ donor registry accessible to organ tissue and eye banks
463 authorized to function as such in this state and shall not be further disseminated."

480 Section 49-5-22, relating to voluntary pre-kindergarten programs to provide toilet facilities
481 screened for privacy, as follows:
482 "49-5-22.
483 (a) The General Assembly finds that just as gender separated toileting separated by one's
484 sex among nonrelatives is the norm among adults, children should be allowed the same
485 opportunity to practice modesty when independent toileting behavior is well established
486 among the majority of their age group. Standardized adherence to this policy would
487 provide privacy, injury control, and sanitation.
488 (b) Each public or private voluntary pre-kindergarten program in this state which receives
489 state funding shall provide toilet facilities for the four-year-old pre-kindergarten age
H. B. 267 (SUB)

494 pre-kindergarten program which provides separate and gender-specific male and female
