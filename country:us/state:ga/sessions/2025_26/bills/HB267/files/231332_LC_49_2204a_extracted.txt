208 PART IV
209 SECTION 4-1.
210 Title 1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to general provisions, is amended
211 in Chapter 2, relating to persons and their rights, by adding a new Code section to read as
212 follows:
213 "1-2-7.1.
214 (a) The General Assembly finds the following with respect to the application of an
215 individual's sex pursuant to any state law or rules and regulations:
216 (1) The term 'sex' refers to an individual's biological sex, either male or female. An
217 individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth and in no case is
218 an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification;
219 (2) With respect to sex, the term 'equal' does not mean same or identical;
220 (3) With respect to sex, separate accommodations are not inherently unequal;
221 (4) An individual born with a medically verifiable diagnosis of disorder or differences
222 in sex development shall be provided any available legal protections and
223 accommodations afforded under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,
224 42 U.S.C. Section 12101 et seq., and any applicable state law;
225 (5) Laws, rules, and regulations that distinguish between the sexes are subject to
226 intermediate constitutional scrutiny. Intermediate constitutional scrutiny forbids unfair
227 discrimination against similarly situated male and female individuals but allows the law
228 to distinguish between the sexes where such distinctions are substantially related to
229 important governmental objections; and
230 (6) Notwithstanding any provision of state law to the contrary, distinctions between the
231 sexes with respect to athletics, living facilities, locker rooms, domestic violence shelters,
232 rape crisis centers, restrooms, and other areas where biology, safety, or privacy are
233 implicated that result in separate accommodations are substantially related to the
H. B. 267
- 10 -
25 LC 49 2204
234 important governmental objections of protecting the health, safety, and privacy of
235 individuals in such circumstances.
236 (b) Any local school system, public school, or any state agency, department, or political
237 subdivision that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with
238 antidiscrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering accurate public health, crime,
239 economic, or other data shall identify each individual who is part of the collected data set
240 as either male or female at birth."
241 SECTION 4-2.
242 Said title is further amended in Code Section 1-3-1, relating to construction of statutes
243 generally, by revising paragraphs (4) through (6) of subsection (d) as follows:
244 "(4) Gender. The masculine gender includes the feminine and the neuter.
245 (5)(4) Joint authority. A joint authority given to any number of persons or officers may
246 be executed by a majority of them, unless it is otherwise declared.
247 (6)(5) Number. The singular or plural number each includes the other, unless the other
248 is expressly excluded.
249 (6) Sex. Masculine words shall include the feminine and neuter."
250 SECTION 4-3.
251 Said title is further amended in Chapter 3, relating to laws and statutes, in Code Section
252 1-3-3, relating to definitions, by adding multiple new paragraphs to read as follows:

254 (7.3) 'Female' means an individual who has, had, or will have the reproductive system
255 capable of the generation, migration, and utilization of eggs for fertilization, or would
256 have such capabilities but for a developmental or genetic anomaly or historical accident."

259 have such capabilities but for a developmental or genetic anomaly or historical accident.

261 human male."
262 "(11.1) 'Mother' means a parent of the female sex."

265 SECTION 5-1.
266 Title 15 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to courts, is amended in Code
267 Section 15-9-90, relating to forms for probate court and local alteration, by revising
268 subsection (b) as follows:
269 "(b) The rules adopted pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section shall provide that the
270 forms so adopted may be altered locally in a particular petition or proceeding in such items
271 as grammar, gender usage sex terminology, the use of singular and plural nouns and
272 pronouns, the omission of optional or alternate language, the inclusion of variable
273 information such as names and addresses, and other nonmaterial ways."
274 SECTION 5-2.
275 Title 17 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to criminal procedure, is
276 amended in Code Section 17-4-20.2, relating to bias crime report, requirements, use of
277 reports, and publication, by revising subsection (a) as follows:
278 "(a) Whenever a law enforcement officer investigates an incident of a crime in which it
279 appears there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the defendant intentionally selected
280 any victim or group of victims or any property as the object of the offense because of such
H. B. 267
- 12 -
25 LC 49 2204
281 victim's or group of victims' actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex,
282 sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability, whether or not an arrest
283 is made, the officer shall prepare and submit to the law enforcement officer's supervisor or
284 other designated person a written report of the incident entitled 'Bias Crime Report.' Forms
285 for such reports shall be designed and provided by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
286 The report shall include:
287 (1) Names of the parties;
288 (2) Relationship of the parties;
289 (3) Sex and gender of the parties;
290 (4) Race of the parties;
291 (5) Religion of the parties;
292 (6) Dates of birth of the parties;
293 (7) Time, place, and date of the incident;
294 (8) Whether there is evidence to indicate that the incident occurred because of a person's
295 actual or perceived attributes as specified by subsection (a) of this Code section;
296 (9) Type and extent of the alleged violation;
297 (10) Existence of any objects or symbols associated with the terrorizing of persons based
298 upon actual or perceived race, religion, or sex;

304 SECTION 5-3.
305 Said title is further amended in Code Section 17-10-17, relating to sentencing of defendants
306 guilty of crimes involving bias or prejudice and identification of increased sentence, by
307 revising subsection (b) as follows:
308 "(b) Subject to the notice requirement provided in Code Section 17-10-18 and in
309 enhancement of the penalty imposed, if the trier of fact determines beyond a reasonable
310 doubt that the defendant intentionally selected any victim or group of victims or any
311 property as the object of the offense because of such victim's or group of victims' actual or
312 perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental
313 disability, or physical disability, the judge imposing sentence shall:
314 (1) If the offense for which the defendant was convicted is a designated misdemeanor,
315 impose a sentence of imprisonment for a period of not less than six nor more than 12
316 months, and a fine not to exceed $5,000.00; or
317 (2) If the offense for which the defendant was convicted is a felony, impose a sentence
318 of imprisonment for a period of not less than two years, and a fine not to exceed
319 $5,000.00."
320 SECTION 5-4.
321 Title 20 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to education, is amended in
322 Code Section 20-2-315, relating to gender discrimination prohibited, authorized separate
323 gender teams, equal athletic opportunity, physical education classes, employee designated
324 to monitor compliance, grievance procedures, and reporting requirements, by revising
325 subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (j) as follows:
326 "(a) No student shall, on the basis of gender sex, be excluded from participation in, be
327 denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another student, or otherwise be
328 discriminated against in any interscholastic or intramural athletics offered by a local school
H. B. 267
- 14 -
25 LC 49 2204
329 system, and no local school system shall provide any such athletics separately on such
330 basis.
331 (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (a) of this Code section, a local school
332 system may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each gender sex where
333 selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact
334 sport. However, where a local school system operates or sponsors a team in a particular
335 sport for members of one gender sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members
336 of the other gender sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that gender sex in that
337 particular sport have previously been limited, members of the excluded gender sex must
338 be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.
339 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system
340 to operate or sponsor a single team for a contact sport that includes members of both
341 genders sexes. As used in this subsection, the term 'contact sport' includes boxing,
342 wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and any other sport the purpose or major
343 activity of which involves bodily contact.
344 (c) A local school system which operates or sponsors interscholastic or intramural athletics
345 shall undertake all reasonable efforts to provide equal athletic opportunity for members of
346 both genders sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available the following
347 factors shall be considered:
348 (1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate
349 the interests and abilities of members of both genders sexes;
350 (2) The provision of equipment and supplies;
351 (3) Scheduling of games and practice time;
352 (4) Travel allowance;
353 (5) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
354 (6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
355 (7) Provision of locker rooms and practice and competitive facilities;
H. B. 267
- 15 -
25 LC 49 2204
356 (8) Provision of medical and training facilities and services; and
357 (9) Publicity.
358 Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each gender sex or unequal expenditures
359 for male and female teams if a local school system operates or sponsors separate teams will
360 not constitute noncompliance with this subsection, but the failure to provide essential funds
361 for the basic operations of teams for one gender sex may be considered in assessing
362 equality of opportunity for members of each gender sex. Nothing in Code Section
363 20-2-411 shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system to expend school
364 tax funds as authorized by Article VIII, Section VI, Paragraph I(b) of the Constitution in
365 order to comply with the requirements of this Code section.
366 (d) A local school system may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities
367 on the basis of gender sex, but such facilities shall be comparable to such facilities
368 provided for students of the other gender sex.
369 (e) This Code section does not prohibit the grouping of students in physical education
370 classes by gender sex."
371 "(j) The Department of Education may publish an annual report of local school systems
372 to include information regarding expenditures and participation rates for each gender sex
373 and such other information as the state board and department deem relevant."
374 SECTION 5-5.
375 Title 40 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to motor vehicles and traffic, is
376 amended in Code Section 40-5-25, relating to applications, fees, provisions for voluntary
377 participation in various programs, by revising subsection (d) as follows:
378 "(d)(1) The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of this state to encourage
379 improved public education and awareness regarding anatomical gifts of human organs
380 and tissues and to address the ever increasing need for donations of anatomical gifts for
381 the benefit of the citizens of Georgia.

208 PART IV
209 SECTION 4-1.
210 Title 1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to general provisions, is amended
211 in Chapter 2, relating to persons and their rights, by adding a new Code section to read as
212 follows:
213 "1-2-7.1.
214 (a) The General Assembly finds the following with respect to the application of an
215 individual's sex pursuant to any state law or rules and regulations:
216 (1) The term 'sex' refers to an individual's biological sex, either male or female. An
217 individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth and in no case is
218 an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification;
219 (2) With respect to sex, the term 'equal' does not mean same or identical;
220 (3) With respect to sex, separate accommodations are not inherently unequal;
221 (4) An individual born with a medically verifiable diagnosis of disorder or differences
222 in sex development shall be provided any available legal protections and
223 accommodations afforded under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,
224 42 U.S.C. Section 12101 et seq., and any applicable state law;
225 (5) Laws, rules, and regulations that distinguish between the sexes are subject to
226 intermediate constitutional scrutiny. Intermediate constitutional scrutiny forbids unfair
227 discrimination against similarly situated male and female individuals but allows the law
228 to distinguish between the sexes where such distinctions are substantially related to
229 important governmental objections; and
230 (6) Notwithstanding any provision of state law to the contrary, distinctions between the
231 sexes with respect to athletics, living facilities, locker rooms, domestic violence shelters,
232 rape crisis centers, restrooms, and other areas where biology, safety, or privacy are
233 implicated that result in separate accommodations are substantially related to the
H. B. 267
- 10 -

25 LC 49 2204
234 important governmental objections of protecting the health, safety, and privacy of
235 individuals in such circumstances.
236 (b) Any local school system, public school, or any state agency, department, or political
237 subdivision that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with
238 antidiscrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering accurate public health, crime,
239 economic, or other data shall identify each individual who is part of the collected data set
240 as either male or female at birth."
241 SECTION 4-2.
242 Said title is further amended in Code Section 1-3-1, relating to construction of statutes
243 generally, by revising paragraphs (4) through (6) of subsection (d) as follows:
244 "(4) Gender. The masculine gender includes the feminine and the neuter.
245 (5)(4) Joint authority. A joint authority given to any number of persons or officers may
246 be executed by a majority of them, unless it is otherwise declared.
247 (6)(5) Number. The singular or plural number each includes the other, unless the other
248 is expressly excluded.
249 (6) Sex. Masculine words shall include the feminine and neuter."
250 SECTION 4-3.
251 Said title is further amended in Chapter 3, relating to laws and statutes, in Code Section
252 1-3-3, relating to definitions, by adding multiple new paragraphs to read as follows:
253 "(7.2) 'Father' means a parent of the male sex.
254 (7.3) 'Female' means an individual who has, had, or will have the reproductive system
255 capable of the generation, migration, and utilization of eggs for fertilization, or would
256 have such capabilities but for a developmental or genetic anomaly or historical accident."
H. B. 267
- 11 -

25 LC 49 2204
257 "(9.1) 'Male' means an individual who has, had, or will have the reproductive system
258 capable of the generation, migration, and utilization of sperm for fertilization, or would
259 have such capabilities but for a developmental or genetic anomaly or historical accident.
260 (9.2) 'Man' means, except when used as a generic reference to human beings, an adult
261 human male."
262 "(11.1) 'Mother' means a parent of the female sex."
263 "(22.1) 'Woman' means a human female."
264 PART V
265 SECTION 5-1.
266 Title 15 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to courts, is amended in Code
267 Section 15-9-90, relating to forms for probate court and local alteration, by revising
268 subsection (b) as follows:
269 "(b) The rules adopted pursuant to subsection (a) of this Code section shall provide that the
270 forms so adopted may be altered locally in a particular petition or proceeding in such items
271 as grammar, gender usage sex terminology, the use of singular and plural nouns and
272 pronouns, the omission of optional or alternate language, the inclusion of variable
273 information such as names and addresses, and other nonmaterial ways."
274 SECTION 5-2.
275 Title 17 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to criminal procedure, is
276 amended in Code Section 17-4-20.2, relating to bias crime report, requirements, use of
277 reports, and publication, by revising subsection (a) as follows:
278 "(a) Whenever a law enforcement officer investigates an incident of a crime in which it
279 appears there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the defendant intentionally selected
280 any victim or group of victims or any property as the object of the offense because of such
H. B. 267
- 12 -

25 LC 49 2204
281 victim's or group of victims' actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex,
282 sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability, whether or not an arrest
283 is made, the officer shall prepare and submit to the law enforcement officer's supervisor or
284 other designated person a written report of the incident entitled 'Bias Crime Report.' Forms
285 for such reports shall be designed and provided by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
286 The report shall include:
287 (1) Names of the parties;
288 (2) Relationship of the parties;
289 (3) Sex and gender of the parties;
290 (4) Race of the parties;
291 (5) Religion of the parties;
292 (6) Dates of birth of the parties;
293 (7) Time, place, and date of the incident;
294 (8) Whether there is evidence to indicate that the incident occurred because of a person's
295 actual or perceived attributes as specified by subsection (a) of this Code section;
296 (9) Type and extent of the alleged violation;
297 (10) Existence of any objects or symbols associated with the terrorizing of persons based
298 upon actual or perceived race, religion, or sex;
299 (11) Number and types of weapons involved, if any;
300 (12) Existence of any prior difficulties between the parties;
301 (13) Type of police action taken in disposition of case;
302 (14) Whether the victim was apprised of available remedies and services; and

25 LC 49 2204
304 SECTION 5-3.
305 Said title is further amended in Code Section 17-10-17, relating to sentencing of defendants
306 guilty of crimes involving bias or prejudice and identification of increased sentence, by
307 revising subsection (b) as follows:
308 "(b) Subject to the notice requirement provided in Code Section 17-10-18 and in
309 enhancement of the penalty imposed, if the trier of fact determines beyond a reasonable
310 doubt that the defendant intentionally selected any victim or group of victims or any
311 property as the object of the offense because of such victim's or group of victims' actual or
312 perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental
313 disability, or physical disability, the judge imposing sentence shall:
314 (1) If the offense for which the defendant was convicted is a designated misdemeanor,
315 impose a sentence of imprisonment for a period of not less than six nor more than 12
316 months, and a fine not to exceed $5,000.00; or
317 (2) If the offense for which the defendant was convicted is a felony, impose a sentence
318 of imprisonment for a period of not less than two years, and a fine not to exceed
319 $5,000.00."
320 SECTION 5-4.
321 Title 20 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to education, is amended in
322 Code Section 20-2-315, relating to gender discrimination prohibited, authorized separate
323 gender teams, equal athletic opportunity, physical education classes, employee designated
324 to monitor compliance, grievance procedures, and reporting requirements, by revising
325 subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (j) as follows:
326 "(a) No student shall, on the basis of gender sex, be excluded from participation in, be
327 denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another student, or otherwise be
328 discriminated against in any interscholastic or intramural athletics offered by a local school
H. B. 267
- 14 -

25 LC 49 2204
329 system, and no local school system shall provide any such athletics separately on such
330 basis.
331 (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (a) of this Code section, a local school
332 system may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each gender sex where
333 selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact
334 sport. However, where a local school system operates or sponsors a team in a particular
335 sport for members of one gender sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members
336 of the other gender sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that gender sex in that
337 particular sport have previously been limited, members of the excluded gender sex must
338 be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.
339 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system
340 to operate or sponsor a single team for a contact sport that includes members of both
341 genders sexes. As used in this subsection, the term 'contact sport' includes boxing,
342 wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and any other sport the purpose or major
343 activity of which involves bodily contact.
344 (c) A local school system which operates or sponsors interscholastic or intramural athletics
345 shall undertake all reasonable efforts to provide equal athletic opportunity for members of
346 both genders sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available the following
347 factors shall be considered:
348 (1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate
349 the interests and abilities of members of both genders sexes;
350 (2) The provision of equipment and supplies;
351 (3) Scheduling of games and practice time;
352 (4) Travel allowance;
353 (5) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
354 (6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
355 (7) Provision of locker rooms and practice and competitive facilities;
H. B. 267
- 15 -

25 LC 49 2204
356 (8) Provision of medical and training facilities and services; and
357 (9) Publicity.
358 Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each gender sex or unequal expenditures
359 for male and female teams if a local school system operates or sponsors separate teams will
360 not constitute noncompliance with this subsection, but the failure to provide essential funds
361 for the basic operations of teams for one gender sex may be considered in assessing
362 equality of opportunity for members of each gender sex. Nothing in Code Section
363 20-2-411 shall be construed to limit the authority of a local school system to expend school
364 tax funds as authorized by Article VIII, Section VI, Paragraph I(b) of the Constitution in
365 order to comply with the requirements of this Code section.
366 (d) A local school system may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities
367 on the basis of gender sex, but such facilities shall be comparable to such facilities
368 provided for students of the other gender sex.
369 (e) This Code section does not prohibit the grouping of students in physical education
370 classes by gender sex."
371 "(j) The Department of Education may publish an annual report of local school systems
372 to include information regarding expenditures and participation rates for each gender sex
373 and such other information as the state board and department deem relevant."
374 SECTION 5-5.
375 Title 40 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to motor vehicles and traffic, is
376 amended in Code Section 40-5-25, relating to applications, fees, provisions for voluntary
377 participation in various programs, by revising subsection (d) as follows:
378 "(d)(1) The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of this state to encourage
379 improved public education and awareness regarding anatomical gifts of human organs
380 and tissues and to address the ever increasing need for donations of anatomical gifts for
381 the benefit of the citizens of Georgia.
H. B. 267

25 LC 49 2204
382 (2) The department shall make available to procurement organizations or secure data
383 centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement organization
384 information provided for in Article 6 of Chapter 5 of Title 44, the 'Georgia Revised
385 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,' including the name, license number, date of birth, gender
386 sex, and most recent address of any person eligible pursuant to Code Section 44-5-142
387 who obtains an organ donor driver's license; provided, however, that the gender
388 information sex category information of either male or female shall be made available
389 only to a procurement organization or secure data center if such organization or center
390 has sufficient funds to cover the associated costs of providing such information.
391 Information so obtained by such organizations and centers shall be used for a state-wide
392 organ donor registry accessible to organ tissue and eye banks authorized to function as
393 such in this state and shall not be further disseminated."
394 SECTION 5-6.
395 Said title is further amended in Code Section 40-5-100, relating to personal identification
396 cards, contents, possession of more than one card prohibited, and optional contributions to
397 and participation in voluntary programs, by revising paragraph (2) of subsection (e) as
398 follows:
399 "(2) The department shall make available to procurement organizations or secure data
400 centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement organization
401 information provided for in Article 6 of Chapter 5 of Title 44, the 'Georgia Revised
402 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,' including the name, identification card number, date of
403 birth, gender sex, and most recent address of any person who obtains an organ donor
404 identification card; provided, however, that the gender information with respect to one's
405 sex shall be made available only to a procurement organization or secure data center if
406 such organization or center has sufficient funds to cover the associated costs of providing
407 such information. Information so obtained by such organizations and centers shall be

25 LC 49 2204
408 used for a state-wide organ donor registry accessible to organ tissue and eye banks
409 authorized to function as such in this state and shall not be further disseminated."
410 SECTION 5-7.
411 Title 44 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to property, is amended in Code
412 Section 44-5-158, relating to donor registry, by revising subsection (a) as follows:
413 "(a) The Department of Driver Services shall make available to procurement organizations
414 or secure data centers maintained and managed at the direction of a procurement
415 organization the name, license number, date of birth, gender sex, and most recent address
416 of any person who obtains an organ donor's license; provided, however, that the gender
417 information with respect to one's sex shall only be made available to a procurement
418 organization or secure data center if such organization or center has sufficient funds to
419 cover the associated costs with providing such information. Information so obtained by
420 such organizations shall be used for the purpose of establishing a state-wide organ donor
421 registry accessible to organ tissue and eye banks authorized to function as such in this state
422 and shall not be further disseminated."
423 SECTION 5-8.
424 Title 49 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to social services, is amended
425 in Article 1 of Chapter 5 of Title 49, relating to children and youth services, by revising Code
426 Section 49-5-22, relating to voluntary pre-kindergarten programs to provide toilet facilities
427 screened for privacy, as follows:
428 "49-5-22.
429 (a) The General Assembly finds that just as gender separated toileting separated by one's
430 sex among nonrelatives is the norm among adults, children should be allowed the same
431 opportunity to practice modesty when independent toileting behavior is well established
H. B. 267
- 18 -

25 LC 49 2204
432 among the majority of their age group. Standardized adherence to this policy would
433 provide privacy, injury control, and sanitation.
434 (b) Each public or private voluntary pre-kindergarten program in this state which receives
435 state funding shall provide toilet facilities for the four-year-old pre-kindergarten age
436 children which it serves which are suitably screened for privacy. Nothing contained in this
437 Code section shall be construed to require a pre-kindergarten program to provide separately
438 constructed toilet facilities.
439 (c) The provisions of subsection (b) of this Code section shall not apply to any voluntary
440 pre-kindergarten program which provides separate and gender-specific male and female
441 toilet facilities for the children which it serves."
