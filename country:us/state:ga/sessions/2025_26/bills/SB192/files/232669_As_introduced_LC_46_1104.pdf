By: Senators Esteves of the 35th, Halpern of the 39th, Jones II of the 22nd, Jackson of the
41st, Parent of the 44th and others
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Chapter 24 of Title 33 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to
2 insurance generally, so as to require the Department of Insurance to implement a certain
3 insurance affordability program in response to the pending expiration of certain Patient
4 Protection and Affordable Care Act tax credits; to provide for definitions; to provide for
5 automatic repeal; to provide for related matters; to provide for a short title; to provide for
6 legislative findings; to provide for an effective date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other
7 purposes.
8 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
9 SECTION 1.
10 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Georgia Health Insurance Affordability
11 and Consumer Protection Act."
12 SECTION 2.
13 The General Assembly finds and declares that:
14 (1) The enhanced premium tax credits (ePTCs) under the federal Patient Protection and
15 Affordable Care Act, also known as the "ACA," have significantly increased the
S. B. 192

25 LC 46 1104
16 affordability of health insurance for low- and middle-income Georgians, reducing the
17 state's uninsured rate;
18 (2) Without Congressional action, the ePTCs will expire on December 31, 2025, and
19 thousands of Georgians, particularly those earning under 250 percent of the federal
20 poverty level, will experience drastic premium increases, making health insurance
21 unaffordable and increasing the number of uninsured individuals;
22 (3) The expiration of these tax credits would disproportionately harm rural communities,
23 small business owners, gig workers, and historically marginalized populations;
24 (4) Several states, including New Mexico, Colorado, and Washington, have implemented
25 state based affordability programs to provide premium and cost-sharing assistance to
26 mitigate rising health insurance costs;
27 (5) Georgia must act swiftly to prevent gaps in affordability and ensure continued access
28 to affordable health insurance for its residents; and
29 (6) The purpose of this Act is to direct the Georgia Department of Insurance to establish
30 a program within statutory requirements established by law to lessen the impact of the
31 ePTCs' expiration, ensuring Georgians continue to have access to affordable, high quality
32 health coverage in 2026.
33 SECTION 3.
34 Chapter 24 of Title 33 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to insurance
35 generally, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
36 "33-24-59.34.
