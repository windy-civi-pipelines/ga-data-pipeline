53 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
54 PART 1.
55 SECTION 1-1.
56 This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "The Georgia Maternal Health Momnibus
57 Act."
58 PART 2.
59 Comprehensive and Equitable Maternal Healthcare
60 SECTION 2-1.
61 (a) The General Assembly of Georgia finds that:
62 (1) Georgia's maternal mortality rate is one of the highest in the nation, regardless of
63 ethnic or socioeconomic background;
64 (2) According to the Commonwealth Fund, in 2020 the United States' mortality rate was
65 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is much higher than the 9.8 average of the
66 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In 2020, Georgia's rate of
67 maternal mortality was 33.0 deaths per 100,000 live births;
H. B. 925
- 3 -

25 LC 60 0091
68 (3) Systemic disparities, including lack of access to quality care across socioeconomic
69 strata, contribute to poor maternal health outcomes. The Department of Public Health
70 reports that over 80 percent of pregnancy related deaths in Georgia are preventable;
71 (4) Reports from the Georgetown Center for Children and Families show that nearly one
72 in five (19.3 percent) of women of childbearing age (18-44) have no health insurance.
73 This is one of the highest rates in the country, leaving Georgia forty-sixth overall as it
74 relates to women's healthcare access. Georgia has the highest uninsured rate in the South,
75 apart from Mississippi where 21.2 percent of women of childbearing age are uninsured;
76 (5) Social determinants of health, such as housing, transportation, and economic stability,
77 significantly impact maternal health outcomes. Data from the Department of Public
78 Health highlights transportation barriers as a leading factor in missed prenatal
79 appointments;
80 (6) Ninety-three rural Georgia counties do not have a hospital with a labor and delivery
81 unit, and there are no rural counties in the state with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
82 Mothers in these areas are often more impacted by lack of transportation, little or no
83 access to the social safety net, and the presence of few perinatal supportive resources; and
84 (7) Federal legislation such as the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2023
85 provides a comprehensive framework to address maternal health disparities, offering
86 Georgia an opportunity to align state efforts with national goals.
87 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to address systemic disparities, invest in social
88 determinants of health, and provide comprehensive support to improve maternal health
89 outcomes for mothers in Georgia.

494 of cesarean delivery, a reduced need for an epidural during labor, lower preterm birth rates,
495 improved rates of breastfeeding, shorter births, reduced rates of perinatal mood and anxiety
496 disorders, increased positive feelings about the birth experience, and feelings of
497 empowerment about individual pregnancy outcomes.
498 (b) As used in this Code section, the term 'doula' means a professional who provides
499 physical, emotional, and informational support to clients before, during, and after childbirth
500 to help them achieve a healthy and satisfying birth experience and who has completed the
501 appropriate training, as determined by the department.

503 provide Medicaid coverage for doula care for pregnant Medicaid recipients. Beginning on

505 each pregnant Medicaid recipient, which may include visits for prepartum care, labor and
506 delivery, and postpartum care.
