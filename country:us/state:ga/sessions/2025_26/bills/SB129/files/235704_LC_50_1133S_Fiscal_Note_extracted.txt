Section 1:
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
February 26, 2025
Honorable Chuck Hufstetler
Chairman, Senate Finance
121-C State Capitol
Atlanta, Georgia 30334
SUBJECT: Fiscal Note
Dear Chairman Hufstetler:
The bill would increase the homestead exemption for a disabled veteran to the full assessed value of
the homestead, while a partially disabled veteran would receive an exemption equal to the
percentage of the veteran’s disability multiplied by the assessed value of the homestead. The bill
would also grant additional homestead exemptions to disabled first responders: totally disabled first
responders would receive an exemption in the full amount of the assessed value while partially
disabled first responders would receive a 50% exemption. The State Board of Workers’
Compensation (SBWC) would provide a letter certifying a qualifying disability for first responders.
The bill would have no fiscal impact on the state. No state revenue is generated from ad valorem
taxes on homesteads. While noting the workload is unclear, SBWC expects to provide the required
letters to first responders with existing resources.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin Richard Dunn, Director
State Auditor Office of Planning and Budget
