16 (a) As used in this Code section, the term:
17 (1) 'Credit or debit card transaction' means a purchase of goods or services by a
18 consumer at a retailer in this state, an online purchase shipped to an address in this state,
19 or a purchase made at a location in this state made using a credit or debit card.
20 (2) 'Goods and services consumer purchase price' means the retail price paid by a
21 consumer for the actual goods or services provided by a retailer, excluding the taxes.
22 (3) 'Interchange fee' means a fee established, charged, or received by a payment card
23 network for the purpose of compensating the payment card issuer or payment card
24 network for its involvement in a credit or debit card transaction.
25 (4) 'Payment card issuer' means a person or entity that issues a credit or debit card or
26 such issuer's agent.
27 (5) 'Payment card network' means an entity that directly or through licensed members,
28 third-party processors, or agents provides the proprietary services, infrastructure, and
29 software that route information and data to conduct credit or debit card transaction
30 authorization, clearance, and settlement. Such term includes the system a person uses in
31 order to accept as a form of payment a brand of debit card, credit card, or other device
32 that may be used to carry out credit or debit card transactions.
33 (6) 'Retailer' means any person, business, or entity that operates a physical or digital

37 applicable to a sale of goods or services provided by a retailer in this state.

42 later than a quarterly basis, refund the amount of interchange fees proportionate to the
43 amount attributable to the taxes. Nothing in this Code section obligates a payment card
44 network to verify the accuracy or completeness of the applicable taxes at the time of sale
45 before calculating the interchange fee specific to each credit or debit card transaction.
46 (d) If a retailer is unable or chooses not to capture and transmit the applicable taxes at the
47 time of sale, the payment card network is not obligated to exclude taxes from the
48 calculation of interchange fees for such retailer's credit or debit card transactions at the time
49 of sale, and, upon receipt of proof of taxes collected by such retailer, the payment card
50 network shall provide the refund on a quarterly basis consistent with subsection (c) of this
51 Code section.
52 (e) A payment card network that willfully violates this Code section shall be subject to a
53 civil penalty of any interchange fees paid by the retailer on the taxes for the goods or
54 services provided by such retailer in a calendar year plus 10 percent.
55 (f) It shall be unlawful to alter or manipulate an interchange fee:
56 (1) By increasing the interchange fee rate that is imposed upon the portion of a credit or
57 debit card transaction;
58 (2) That is not attributable to taxes; and
59 (3) That is imposed to circumvent the effect of this Code section."
60 SECTION 3.
61 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
