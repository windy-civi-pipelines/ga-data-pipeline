905 against any person for making a report or providing information pursuant to this article or
- 36 -
25 LC 57 0270S
906 against any resident or former resident who is the subject of a report. Nothing in this Code
907 section shall be construed to prohibit the termination of the relationship between the
908 community living arrangement and the resident for reasons other than that the community
909 living arrangement has been made the subject of a report, that such a report has been made,
910 or that information has been provided pursuant to this article.
911 37-13-27.

882 not be disclosed to the public unless required to be revealed in court proceedings or upon
883 the written consent of the person whose identity is to be revealed or as otherwise required
884 by law. Upon the resident's or the former resident's, or his or her representative's, request,
885 the department shall make information obtained in an abuse or exploitation report and
886 investigation available to the allegedly abused or exploited resident, the allegedly abused
887 or exploited former resident, or his or her representative for inspection or duplication,
888 except that such disclosure shall be made without revealing the identity of any other
889 resident, the person making the report, or persons providing information by name or
890 inference. For the purpose of this Code section, the term 'representative' means any person
891 authorized in writing by the resident or former resident or appointed by an appropriate
892 court to act upon the resident's or former resident's behalf. The term 'representative' also
893 means a family member of a deceased or physically or mentally impaired resident or
894 former resident unable to grant authorization; provided, however, that such family
895 members who do not have written or court authorization shall not be authorized by this
896 Code section to receive the resident's or former resident's clinical records as defined in
897 Code Section 37-3-1, 37-4-2, or 37-7-1. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed
898 to deny agencies participating in joint investigations at the request of and with the
899 department, or conducting separate investigations of abuse or exploitation within an
900 agency's scope of authority, or law enforcement personnel who are conducting an
901 investigation into any criminal offense in which a resident or former resident is a victim
902 from having access to such records.
903 37-13-26.
904 No person or community living arrangement shall discriminate or retaliate in any manner
905 against any person for making a report or providing information pursuant to this article or

906 against any resident or former resident who is the subject of a report. Nothing in this Code
907 section shall be construed to prohibit the termination of the relationship between the
908 community living arrangement and the resident for reasons other than that the community
909 living arrangement has been made the subject of a report, that such a report has been made,
910 or that information has been provided pursuant to this article.
911 37-13-27.
912 The department shall prepare a written notice describing the reporting requirements set
913 forth in this article. Such notice shall be distributed to all community living arrangements
914 in this state, and copies thereof shall be posted in conspicuous locations within community
915 living arrangements."
