Dear Representative Leverett:
This substitute bill would amend provisions relating to retirement allowances for certain members of
the Georgia Judicial Retirement System. Currently, the normal retirement age for all members of the
Georgia Judicial Retirement System is 60 years of age. This substitute bill would change the method
for calculating retirement allowances for any person who becomes a member of the System on or after
the effective date of this bill and serves as a superior court judge.
Under the provisions of this bill, any person who first becomes a member after the effective date of
this bill may still retire at 60 years of age. However, their retirement allowance would be reduced by
any service time earned while serving as a superior court judge. Once such person reaches 65 years
of age, their retirement allowance would be adjusted to account for all years of creditable service
earned as a member of the Georgia Judicial Retirement System. It should be noted that all members
would still become vested for a retirement allowance after 10 years of service in the System.
This is to certify that this substitute bill is a nonfiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public
Retirement Systems Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
