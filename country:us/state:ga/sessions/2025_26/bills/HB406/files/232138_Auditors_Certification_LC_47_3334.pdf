SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
House Bill (LC 47 3334)
Dear Representative Leverett:
This bill would amend provisions relating to retirement for certain members of the Georgia Judicial
Retirement System. Currently, the normal retirement age for all members of the Georgia Judicial
Retirement System is 60 years of age. This bill would increase the normal retirement age for members
who hold the office of superior court judge from 60 years to 65 years of age. This change would only
apply to persons who take such office on or after July 1, 2026. The normal retirement age would
remain 60 years of age for any person who holds the office of superior court judge prior to the effective
date.
This is to certify that this bill is a nonfiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems
Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
