156 retirement allowance throughout the life of and paid to the designated survivor.
157 (3) Option three, known as the 50 percent joint and survivor option, shall consist of a
158 reduced retirement allowance which is payable during the life of the retired member and

162 or three, with the added provision that in the event the designated survivor predeceases
163 the retired member, the retirement allowance payable to the retired member after the
164 death of the designated survivor shall be equal to the maximum retirement allowance
165 which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under this chapter had such
166 election not been made.
167 (c) In the event a member is not married at the time he or she retires and the retired
168 member does not elect a survivor's option and such member subsequently marries, the
169 retired member may elect to begin receiving an actuarially reduced benefit of equivalent
170 value and establish on behalf of the newly acquired spouse an option under this Code
171 section. Such election shall be made within six months after the marriage.

173 section on behalf of a spouse and such spouse predeceases the retired member and the
174 retired member subsequently remarries, the retired member may elect to begin receiving
175 an actuarially reduced benefit of equivalent value and establish on behalf of a new
176 designated survivor pursuant to an option under this Code section.
177 (e) In the event a retired member makes an election under subsection (b) of this Code
178 section on behalf of a spouse and a final judgment of complete divorce from the spouse is
179 entered, then:
180 (1) The retired member may elect to continue the optional allowance with the former
181 spouse designated to receive all amounts and benefits upon the death of the retired
182 member; or
183 (2) The retired member may revoke the appointment of such spouse as a beneficiary;
184 provided, however, that in such event the retirement benefit received by the retired
185 member shall not increase. Such revocation may be made at any time after the entry of
186 the final judgment of divorce. If the retired member elects to revoke the election, the
187 spouse shall be treated in the same manner as if he or she had predeceased the retired
188 member under subsection (d) of this Code section.
189 (f) If an active vested member of this retirement system dies and is survived by a legal
190 spouse, such spouse shall receive a benefit as if the member has retired on the date of his
191 or her death, had attained the age of 65, and had elected option three."

200 who is receiving benefits pursuant to this chapter or to supplement the benefit being paid
201 pursuant to this chapter to any beneficiary of any deceased superior court judge or district
202 attorney.
203 (b) Whenever any county which has a state court supplements the salary of the judges or
204 solicitors-general of such court, the governing authority of such county shall be authorized,
205 but not required, to supplement the benefit being paid pursuant to this chapter to any retired
206 state court judge of such court who is receiving benefits pursuant to this chapter or
207 supplement the benefit being paid pursuant to this chapter to any beneficiary of any
208 deceased state court judge.
209 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this Code section, for any
210 single county judicial circuit where the county site is located in an unincorporated area of
211 the county and the county governing authority has constructed one or more permanent
212 satellite courthouses within the county, said county shall supplement the benefit amount
213 being paid pursuant to this chapter to any district attorney who retired from such circuit.
214 The amount of the supplement shall be determined by multiplying the benefit percentage
215 he or she earned pursuant to Code Section 47-23-102 if such member first became a
216 member before the effective date of this Act or Code Section 47-23-102.1 if such member
217 first became a member on or after the effective date of this Act at retirement together with
218 the aggregate county salary supplement being paid to the active district attorney on the date

122 two-thirds of the maximum retirement benefits provided by Code Section 47-23-102 or
123 47-23-102.1.
124 (c) The disability of any member applying for disability retirement benefits shall be

139 with one of the options set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection. Such
140 retirement allowance shall be actuarially reduced in accordance to the designated survivor's

142 Section 47-23-102.1, such actuarial adjustment shall account for any increase in the benefit
143 amount accruing to such member when he or she attains the age of 65 years. Such actuarial

151 which, upon his or her death, shall be continued at the same rate throughout the life of
152 and paid to the designated survivor.
153 (2) Option two, known as the 66 2/3 percent joint and survivor option, shall consist of
154 a reduced retirement allowance which is payable during the life of the retired member and
155 which, upon his or her death, shall be continued at the rate of two-thirds the reduced
156 retirement allowance throughout the life of and paid to the designated survivor.
157 (3) Option three, known as the 50 percent joint and survivor option, shall consist of a
158 reduced retirement allowance which is payable during the life of the retired member and
159 which, upon his or her death, shall be continued at the rate of one-half the reduced
160 retirement allowance throughout the life of and paid to the designated survivor.
161 (4) Option four, known as the pop-up option, shall be the election of options one, two,
162 or three, with the added provision that in the event the designated survivor predeceases
163 the retired member, the retirement allowance payable to the retired member after the
164 death of the designated survivor shall be equal to the maximum retirement allowance
165 which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under this chapter had such
166 election not been made.
167 (c) In the event a member is not married at the time he or she retires and the retired
168 member does not elect a survivor's option and such member subsequently marries, the
169 retired member may elect to begin receiving an actuarially reduced benefit of equivalent
170 value and establish on behalf of the newly acquired spouse an option under this Code
171 section. Such election shall be made within six months after the marriage.

175 an actuarially reduced benefit of equivalent value and establish on behalf of a new
176 designated survivor pursuant to an option under this Code section.
177 (e) In the event a retired member makes an election under subsection (b) of this Code
178 section on behalf of a spouse and a final judgment of complete divorce from the spouse is
179 entered, then:
180 (1) The retired member may elect to continue the optional allowance with the former
181 spouse designated to receive all amounts and benefits upon the death of the retired
182 member; or
183 (2) The retired member may revoke the appointment of such spouse as a beneficiary;
184 provided, however, that in such event the retirement benefit received by the retired
185 member shall not increase. Such revocation may be made at any time after the entry of
186 the final judgment of divorce. If the retired member elects to revoke the election, the
187 spouse shall be treated in the same manner as if he or she had predeceased the retired
188 member under subsection (d) of this Code section.
189 (f) If an active vested member of this retirement system dies and is survived by a legal
190 spouse, such spouse shall receive a benefit as if the member has retired on the date of his
191 or her death, had attained the age of 65, and had elected option three."

212 satellite courthouses within the county, said county shall supplement the benefit amount

216 member before the effective date of this Act or Code Section 47-23-102.1 if such member
