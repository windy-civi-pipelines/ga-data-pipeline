Senate Resolution 432
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the Senate Higher Education in Prison Study Committee; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, higher education is a strong determinant of employment outcomes, social
3 mobility, and future income because it equips individuals with the knowledge and skills
4 needed to contribute effectively to society; and
5 WHEREAS, the 2023 overhaul of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid program
6 allotted federal Pell Grants to people in prisons and increased total spending by $617 million,
7 giving the nation the greatest opportunity to expand higher education in prison since such
8 grants were cut in 1994; and
9 WHEREAS, there are currently more than 47,000 Georgians in our state prisons, which cost
10 taxpayers $1.32 billion in 2024; and
11 WHEREAS, the rate of recidivism in Georgia is at least 30 percent, and postsecondary
12 education has been found to be the most effective educational program at reducing
13 recidivism with multiple studies finding that education in prison reduces its rate by 43
14 percent; and

25 LC 61 0238
15 WHEREAS, providing postsecondary education to people in prisons will add specialized
16 laborers to Georgia's economy, bolstering our workforce to remain the number one state to
17 do business; and
18 WHEREAS, providing postsecondary education in prison will allow people in prisons to use
19 their time more productively, boost self-motivation and mental health, and develop real
20 career skills to apply after release; and
21 WHEREAS, entire communities benefit when people released from prison return as more
22 productive and educated individuals ready to contribute to their community; and
23 WHEREAS, previous studies have found that states ultimately offset all costs of
24 implementing postsecondary education in prisons with future savings from reduced rates of
25 recidivism; and
26 WHEREAS, other southern states have taken action in the form of expanding the number of
27 colleges, universities, and technical schools offering small business training; and
28 WHEREAS, the Georgia Coalition for Higher Education in Prison and its associated
29 organizations have started groundbreaking programs in Georgia's prisons, but their ability
30 to expand educational opportunities and provide transition services is limited; and
31 WHEREAS, the aforesaid coalition and other organizations have identified five categories
32 of challenges and obstacles for people in prisons continuing their postsecondary education
33 after release, including issues related to scholarship eligibility, housing obtainment,
34 behavioral health services, medical care, and access to employment; and
