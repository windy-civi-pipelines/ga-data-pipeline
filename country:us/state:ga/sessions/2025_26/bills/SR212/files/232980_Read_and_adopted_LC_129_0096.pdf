A RESOLUTION
1 Honoring the legacy of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, nicknamed the "Six Triple
3 Eight," was an all-Black battalion of the United States Women's Army Corps that managed
4 postal services from 1945 to 1946; and
5 WHEREAS, there was a significant shortage of soldiers who were able to manage the postal
6 service for the United States Army overseas during World War II, resulting in millions of
7 pieces of undelivered mail; and
8 WHEREAS, led by Major Charity Adams, the battalion consisted of 855 women and was the
9 only predominantly Black United States Women's Army Corps unit sent overseas during
10 World War II; and
11 WHEREAS, while most of the women of the 6888th served as postal clerks, some served as
12 cooks, mechanics, and other support positions, enabling the Six Triple Eight to operate as a
13 self-sufficient unit; and

14 WHEREAS, the women of the Six Triple Eight worked around the clock to sort and deliver
15 packages and letters to soldiers, creating and maintaining their own card index system in
16 order to properly identify the large quantities of mail; and
17 WHEREAS, despite the sexual and racial discrimination they faced, the soldiers were able
18 to efficiently and effectively clear backlogs in the United Kingdom and France, processing
19 an estimated 65,000 pieces of mail per shift; and
20 WHEREAS, at the end of the war, the women of the 6888th received no public recognition
21 for their monumental contributions upon disbandment; and
22 WHEREAS, in December 2024, Tyler Perry wrote, directed, and produced a Netflix film
23 titled The Six Triple Eight, bringing light to the often under-represented stories of the
24 battalion; and
25 WHEREAS, it is abundantly fitting and proper that the legacy of this exemplary battalion
26 and the women who served as part of it be appropriately honored.
27 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
28 honor the resilience, efficiency, and determination of the women of the 6888th Central Postal
29 Directory Battalion and extend the most sincere gratitude for their distinguished service.
