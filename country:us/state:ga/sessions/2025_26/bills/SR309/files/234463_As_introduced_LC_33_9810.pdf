A RESOLUTION
1 Proposing an amendment to the Constitution so as to require any bill proposing any sales or
2 income tax credit or sales or income tax exemption to receive a two-thirds' vote of the
3 membership of each house of the General Assembly in order to become law; to provide for
4 legislative findings; to provide for submission of this amendment for ratification or rejection;
5 and for other purposes.
6 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
7 SECTION 1.
8 The General Assembly finds that:
9 (1) Surrounding states to Georgia have eliminated state income tax;
10 (2) Currently, Georgia state income tax makes up almost 50 percent of state revenue per
11 year;
12 (3) There are measures in place to step down state income tax rates and it is anticipated
13 that further measures will be proposed to eliminate state income tax altogether in Georgia;
14 and
15 (4) In efforts to move this state toward a consumption based tax stream model and phase
16 out state income tax, it would be prudent to eliminate special interest tax credits so that all
17 Georgians are treated equally.
