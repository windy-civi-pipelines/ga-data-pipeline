5 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
6 SECTION 1.
7 Chapter 5 of Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to water resources,
8 is amended by revising paragraph (3) of subsection (b) and subsection (m.1) of Code
9 Section 12-5-31, relating to regulated riparian rights to surface waters for general or farm
10 use, permits for withdrawal, diversion, or impoundment, coordination with water plans,
11 metering of farm use, interbasin transfers, and appeal procedures, as follows:
12 "(3)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section to the contrary, a
13 permit for the withdrawal or diversion of surface waters for farm uses shall be issued
14 by the director to any person when the applicant submits an application which provides
15 reasonable proof that the applicant's farm use of surface waters occurred prior to
16 July 1, 1988, and when any such application is submitted prior to July 1, 1991. If
H. B. 143

25 LC 44 3002S/AP
17 submitted prior to July 1, 1991, an application for a permit to be issued based upon
18 farm uses of surface waters occurring prior to July 1, 1988, shall be granted for the
19 withdrawal or diversion of surface waters at a rate of withdrawal or diversion equal to
20 the greater of the operating capacity in place for withdrawal or diversion on
21 July 1, 1988, or, when measured in gallons per day on a monthly average for a calendar
22 year, the greatest withdrawal or diversion capacity during the five-year period
23 immediately preceding July 1, 1988. If submitted after July 1, 1991, or, regardless of
24 when submitted, if it is based upon a withdrawal or diversion of surface waters for farm
25 uses occurring or proposed to occur on or after July 1, 1988, an application shall be
26 subject to evaluation and classification pursuant to subsections (e), (f), and (g) of this
27 Code section, but a permit based upon such evaluation and classification shall be issued
28 to ensure the applicant's right to a reasonable use of such surface waters. Any permit
29 issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be conditioned upon the requirement that the
30 permittee shall provide, on forms prescribed by the director, information relating to a
31 general description of the lands and number of acres subject to irrigation and the
32 permit; a description of the general type of irrigation system used; the source of
33 withdrawal water such as river, stream, or impoundment; and pump information,
34 including rated capacity, pump location, and power information.
35 (B) Permits applied for under this paragraph on or after April 20, 2006, for farm use
36 in the Flint River basin shall have a term of 25 years and shall be automatically
37 renewed at the original permitted capacity unless an evaluation by the division indicates
38 that renewal at the original capacity would have unreasonable adverse effects upon
39 other water uses. The division may renew the original permit at a lower capacity, but
40 such capacity shall be based on the reasonable use of the permittee and evaluation of
41 the resource.

42 (C) A permittee may apply to have a permit issued under this paragraph modified,
43 amended, transferred, or assigned to subsequent owners of the lands which are the
44 subject of such permit; provided, however, that:
45 (i) The division shall receive written notice of any such transfer or assignment;
46 (ii) Any modification in or amendment to the use or capacity conditions contained
47 in the permit or in the lands which are the subject of such permit shall require the
48 permittee to submit an application for review and approval by the director consistent
49 with this Code section; and
50 (iii) The permittee may commence withdrawing water under the modified, amended,
51 transferred, or assigned permit on the effective date stated on the revised permit for
52 farm use; and
53 (iv) For all permits for which such modification, amendment, transfer, or assignment
54 is effective on or after April 20, 2018, and for which no water-measuring device is
55 installed, the permittee shall have one year from the updated effective date stated on
56 the revised permit for farm use to have an acceptable type of water-measuring device
57 installed, to have such device in operation at each point of permitted withdrawal, and
58 to notify the division in writing once the installation has occurred. The division shall
59 approve or disapprove the installation within 60 days of the date of notification. The
60 permittee shall be responsible for all associated costs.
61 (D) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as a repeal or modification of Code
62 Section 12-5-46."
63 "(m.1)(1) The division shall have the duty of implementing a program of measuring farm
64 uses of water in order to obtain clear and accurate information on the patterns and
65 amounts of such use, which information is essential to proper management of water
66 resources by the state and useful to farmers for improving the efficiency and effectiveness
67 of their use of water, meeting the requirements of subsections (b) and (m) of this Code
68 section, and improving water conservation.
