A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Chapter 5 of Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to water
2 resources, so as to revise provisions regarding water-measuring devices for farm use of
3 surface and ground water; to provide for related matters; to repeal conflicting laws; and for
4 other purposes.
5 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
6 SECTION 1.
7 Chapter 5 of Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to water resources,
8 is amended by revising paragraph (3) of subsection (b) and subsection (m.1) of Code
9 Section 12-5-31, relating to regulated riparian rights to surface waters for general or farm
10 use, permits for withdrawal, diversion, or impoundment, coordination with water plans,
11 metering of farm use, interbasin transfers, and appeal procedures, as follows:
12 "(3)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section to the contrary, a
13 permit for the withdrawal or diversion of surface waters for farm uses shall be issued
14 by the director to any person when the applicant submits an application which provides
15 reasonable proof that the applicant's farm use of surface waters occurred prior to July
16 1, 1988, and when any such application is submitted prior to July 1, 1991. If submitted
H. B. 143

25 LC 44 2929
17 prior to July 1, 1991, an application for a permit to be issued based upon farm uses of
18 surface waters occurring prior to July 1, 1988, shall be granted for the withdrawal or
19 diversion of surface waters at a rate of withdrawal or diversion equal to the greater of
20 the operating capacity in place for withdrawal or diversion on July 1, 1988, or, when
21 measured in gallons per day on a monthly average for a calendar year, the greatest
22 withdrawal or diversion capacity during the five-year period immediately preceding
23 July 1, 1988. If submitted after July 1, 1991, or, regardless of when submitted, if it is
24 based upon a withdrawal or diversion of surface waters for farm uses occurring or
25 proposed to occur on or after July 1, 1988, an application shall be subject to evaluation
26 and classification pursuant to subsections (e), (f), and (g) of this Code section, but a
27 permit based upon such evaluation and classification shall be issued to ensure the
28 applicant's right to a reasonable use of such surface waters. Any permit issued pursuant
29 to this paragraph shall be conditioned upon the requirement that the permittee shall
30 provide, on forms prescribed by the director, information relating to a general
31 description of the lands and number of acres subject to irrigation and the permit; a
32 description of the general type of irrigation system used; the source of withdrawal water
33 such as river, stream, or impoundment; and pump information, including rated capacity,
34 pump location, and power information.
35 (B) Permits applied for under this paragraph on or after April 20, 2006, for farm use
36 in the Flint River basin shall have a term of 25 years and shall be automatically
37 renewed at the original permitted capacity unless an evaluation by the division indicates
38 that renewal at the original capacity would have unreasonable adverse effects upon
39 other water uses. The division may renew the original permit at a lower capacity, but
40 such capacity shall be based on the reasonable use of the permittee and evaluation of
41 the resource.

25 LC 44 2929
42 (C) A permittee may apply to have a permit issued under this paragraph modified,
43 amended, transferred, or assigned to subsequent owners of the lands which are the
44 subject of such permit; provided, however, that:
45 (i) The division shall receive written notice of any such transfer or assignment;
46 (ii) Any modification in or amendment to the use or capacity conditions contained
47 in the permit or in the lands which are the subject of such permit shall require the
48 permittee to submit an application for review and approval by the director consistent
49 with this Code section; and
50 (iii) The permittee may commence withdrawing water under the modified, amended,
51 transferred, or assigned permit on the effective date stated on the revised permit for
52 farm use; and
53 (iv) For all permits for which such modification, amendment, transfer, or assignment
54 is effective on or after April 20, 2018, and for which no water-measuring device is
55 installed, the permittee shall have one year from the updated effective date stated on
56 the revised permit for farm use to have an acceptable type of water-measuring device
57 installed, to have such device in operation at each point of permitted withdrawal, and
58 to notify the division in writing once the installation has occurred. The division shall
59 approve or disapprove the installation within 60 days of the date of notification. The
60 permittee shall be responsible for all associated costs.
61 (D) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as a repeal or modification of Code
62 Section 12-5-46."
63 "(m.1)(1) The division shall have the duty of implementing a program of measuring farm
64 uses of water in order to obtain clear and accurate information on the patterns and
65 amounts of such use, which information is essential to proper management of water
66 resources by the state and useful to farmers for improving the efficiency and effectiveness
67 of their use of water, meeting the requirements of subsections (b) and (m) of this Code
68 section, and improving water conservation.

125 water-measuring devices installed pursuant to this Code section where maintenance,
126 repair, or replacement is required to ensure that such water-measuring devices accurately
127 reflect the amount of water used, and no charge shall be made to the permittee for such
128 costs.
129 (9) If the division determines that the permittee or the permittee's employees, tenants,
130 licensees, or agents have willfully dismantled, sold, relocated, or removed any
131 water-measuring device installed pursuant to this Code section, the permittee may be
132 subject to enforcement action by the division, including but not limited to imposition of
133 civil penalties.
134 (10) Any reports of amounts of use for recreational purposes under this Code section
135 shall be compiled separately from amounts reported for all other farm uses."

- 6 -

25 LC 44 2929
147 that renewal at the original capacity would have unreasonable adverse effects upon other
148 water uses. The division may renew the original permit at a lower capacity, but such
149 capacity shall be based on the reasonable use of the permittee and evaluation of the
150 resource;
151 (2) A permittee may apply to have a permit issued under this Code section modified,
152 amended, transferred, or assigned to subsequent owners of the lands which are the subject
153 of such permit; provided, however, that:
