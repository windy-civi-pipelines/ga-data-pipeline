SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
House Bill (LC 56 0328)
Dear Representative Blackmon:
This bill would amend provisions relating to the employment of beneficiaries under the Teachers Retirement
System of Georgia. Current law allows certain retired teachers to return to work full-time and continue
receiving their retirement allowance and any postretirement benefit adjustments they are eligible to receive.
This provision is only available to rehired teachers that are certified for pre-kindergarten through Grade 12 and
are hired for a position that is designated as an area of highest need, as determined for the Regional Education
Service Agency (RESA) in which the school system is assigned.
Currently, this provision is set to expire on June 30, 2026. If this legislation is enacted, this provision would be
extended through June 30, 2030.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems Standards
Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
