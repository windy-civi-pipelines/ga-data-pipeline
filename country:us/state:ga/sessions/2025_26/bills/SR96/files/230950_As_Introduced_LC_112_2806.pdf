25 LC 112 2806
14 WHEREAS, purebred dogs are working dogs, serving as avalanche dogs, trackers and
15 trailers, herders, controllers of vermin, water rescuers, carting and sled dogs, retrievers,
16 protectors, hunters, and bird dogs, and they are always the heartbeat of a companion near and
17 dear to humans; and
18 WHEREAS, all dogs should be valued regardless of their ancestry, but the purpose-bred dog
19 and the predictability of its breed should be cherished and preserved; and
20 WHEREAS, each breed is incredibly etched in the history of the culture that created it, just
21 as surely as that culture's music, art, and language, making it abundantly fitting that we
22 recognize purebred dogs.
23 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
24 commend the benefits and contributions of purebred dogs and recognize May 1, 2025, as
25 Purebred Dog Day in the State of Georgia.
26 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
27 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and the
28 press.
