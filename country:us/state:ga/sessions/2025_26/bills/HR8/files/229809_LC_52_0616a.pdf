A RESOLUTION
1 Supporting the creation of a State Workgroup to Increase Chronic Disease Information and
2 Screenings in Communities of Color; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, disparities in health outcomes are increasingly costly to the state, but are in
4 large part preventable; and
5 WHEREAS, people with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory
6 disease, blood disease, lupus, HIV, and kidney disease, require integrated and coordinated
7 healthcare services, including diagnosis, treatment, management, and medication, from a
8 variety of providers; and
9 WHEREAS, patients with these and other chronic diseases and their families, caregivers, and
10 employers and the health system experience a disproportionately high economic, clinical, and
11 social burden; and
12 WHEREAS, both the maintenance of overall well-being and management of underlying
13 health conditions are crucial for individuals in high-risk communities; and

14 WHEREAS, identifying barriers to obtaining chronic disease information and screenings is
15 a first step toward breaking down these barriers; and
16 WHEREAS, patients with these and other chronic diseases, particularly patients from
17 minority populations, were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and are likely to be
18 disproportionately impacted by any future health crises; and
19 WHEREAS, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges
20 that social and economic differences often create health differences in communities of color,
21 and that public health emergencies can isolate communities of color from necessary
22 resources; and
23 WHEREAS, the CDC acknowledges that COVID-19 death rates among
24 black/African-American persons and Hispanic/Latino persons were substantially higher than
25 the death rate among other persons; and
26 WHEREAS, patients in rural communities in this state are particularly challenged in
27 receiving adequate and appropriate health information and screenings; and
28 WHEREAS, it would be beneficial to create a workgroup to increase chronic disease
29 information and screenings in communities of color.
30 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
31 the members of this body support:
32 (1) The creation of a State Workgroup to Increase Chronic Disease Information and
33 Screenings in Communities of Color (the Workgroup);
