44 county shall continue to provide police and law enforcement services within the
45 boundaries of the qualified municipality in the same manner as other parts of the
46 special district.
47 (ii) In the event that, at the end of a fiscal year for the special district, the actual

52 deliver such excess funds to the qualified municipality.
53 (iii) For the purpose of complying with division (ii) of this subparagraph, the actual

173 in subsection (e) of this Code section. Such corrections, revisions, or additional data shall
174 be certified to the Commissioner by the Office of Planning and Budget on or before August
