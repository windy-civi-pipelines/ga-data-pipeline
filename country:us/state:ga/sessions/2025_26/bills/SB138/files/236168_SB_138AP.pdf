21 SECTION 1.
22 Chapter 31 of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to incorporation
23 of municipal corporations, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
24 "36-31-11.2.

26 (1) 'County' means a county with more than 15 municipalities wholly or partially located
27 within its boundaries.
28 (2) 'Qualified municipality' means any new municipality created by local Act which
29 becomes law on or after January 1, 2024.
30 (3) 'Transition period' means the period for the transition of governmental services from
31 a county to a qualified municipality as provided for by this chapter or the local Act
32 incorporating such qualified municipality.
33 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary:
34 (1)(A) When a qualified municipality is created within a county which has a special
35 district consisting of both the unincorporated area and certain incorporated areas of the
36 county for the provision of police or law enforcement services, the territory within the
37 new qualified municipality shall remain in such special district until the qualified
38 municipality notifies the county of its intention to leave such special district and assume
39 full responsibility for the provision of police and law enforcement services. In no event
40 shall a qualified municipality be required to provide more than one year's notice prior
41 to exercising the option provided for in this paragraph to leave such special district if

43 of certified peace officers.
44 (B)(i) During the period that a qualified municipality remains within a police or law
45 enforcement special district as provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the
46 county shall continue to provide police and law enforcement services within the
47 boundaries of the qualified municipality in the same manner as other parts of the
48 special district.
49 (ii) In the event that, at the end of a fiscal year for the special district, the actual
50 special district ad valorem taxes collected within the boundaries of the qualified
51 municipality are greater than the actual costs incurred by the county in providing
52 police or law enforcement services within the boundaries of the qualified
53 municipality, within 60 days of the final day of such fiscal year, the county shall
54 deliver such excess funds to the qualified municipality.
55 (iii) For the purpose of complying with division (ii) of this subparagraph, the actual
56 costs of providing police or law enforcement services within the qualified
57 municipality shall be calculated based upon the actual time county police or law
58 enforcement officers spend providing police or law enforcement services within the
59 boundaries of the qualified municipality. The costs of such police and law
60 enforcement services shall include the costs of county police or law enforcement
61 officers:
62 (I) Patrolling and responding to dispatches or calls for service within the qualified
63 municipality; and
64 (II) Investigating crimes originating within the qualified municipality regardless of
65 the physical location where such investigative activities occur.
66 (iv) The fiscal authority for a special district for the provision of police or law
67 enforcement services shall have the duty of tracking all information and making all
68 calculations necessary to comply with the provisions of this paragraph.

84 Regardless of any transition period, the county shall continue to control, maintain, and

86 incorporation of the qualified municipality until the qualified municipality and the county
87 agree otherwise.
88 (4)(A) In the event that:
89 (i) A qualified municipality succeeds to the control of local government services

101 collection.
102 (B) This paragraph shall apply, but not be limited, to alcoholic beverage fees and taxes,

114 permit or other official approval of activity relating to a governmental service assumed
115 by the qualified municipality, and the related permitting or regulatory process is not
116 fully completed by the county by the time the qualified municipality succeeds to the
117 provision of such service, and such fees are not fully refunded to the applicant, the
118 county shall transfer and remit to the qualified municipality the following percentage
119 of such fees collected by the county:
120 (i) Ninety-five percent if no action beyond mere acceptance has been taken upon the
121 application;

25 SB 138/AP
122 (ii) Seventy-five percent if the application has been processed but no required
123 inspections have occurred; or

125 approval or permits have not be issued.
126 (C) The county shall transfer all required funds to the qualified municipality within 30
127 days of being obligated to remit fees as required by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
128 (6) The incorporation of a qualified municipality shall not require the county or any

130 agreement enacted pursuant to Chapter 72 of this title that is in place on the date that the
131 qualified municipality is incorporated. In lieu of such agreement being renegotiated
132 during any transition period, the qualified municipality may elect to have the county

134 the county is providing to either another municipality or the unincorporated areas of the
135 county pursuant to the then-current service delivery strategy agreement. The county shall
136 provide any such elected services to the qualified municipality under the same conditions
137 and in the same manner as it provides to the other municipality or the unincorporated area

144 (c)(1) In the event that:
145 (A) A county fails to comply with the transition provisions provided for in this Code
146 section, a qualified municipality is forced to seek judicial remedies for such failure to
147 comply, and the qualified municipality is ultimately successful in such legal action; or
S. B. 138
- 6 -

25 SB 138/AP
148 (B) A qualified municipality is subject to a legal action initiated by a third party
149 seeking to enforce its rights as a result of the qualified municipality's failure to meet a
150 duty or obligation provided by law, and the qualified municipality's failure to meet such
151 duty or obligation was the direct result of actions taken by a county relating to the
152 transition of services between the county and qualified municipality,
153 then the county shall be responsible for reimbursing the qualified municipality for all
154 legal expenses incurred by such qualified municipality in prosecuting or defending such
155 action as well as any damages paid by the qualified municipality to such injured third
156 party. The sovereign immunity of the county is waived to the extent necessary to
157 effectuate this paragraph.

159 violated any duty or obligation arising from this chapter, the sovereign immunity of such

175 to any newly incorporated municipality shall be backdated to the initial filing provided for

177 is insufficient, the Commissioner shall use the census tract data from the charter of the
178 newly incorporated municipality in lieu of the official census data. Such corrections,
179 revisions, or additional data shall be certified to the Commissioner by the Office of
180 Planning and Budget on or before August 31 of each year.
181 (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code section to the contrary, in the event

196 such municipality has completed all steps necessary to impose a tax as provided for in this
197 Code section, and the proceeds of such tax have not already been allocated by the
198 Commissioner, such municipality shall be entitled to be considered a municipality pursuant
