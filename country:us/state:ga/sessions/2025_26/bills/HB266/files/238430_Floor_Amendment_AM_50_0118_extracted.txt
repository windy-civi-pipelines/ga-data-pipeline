108 foundation pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (g) except for division (g)(1)(B)(iv)
109 of this Code section.
110 (d) Any valid law enforcement foundation as a qualified law enforcement foundation shall
111 be certified by the commissioner following the commissioner's receipt of a properly
112 completed application and after the commissioner has confirmed that a single local law
113 enforcement unit has validly designated the applicant as its sole law enforcement
114 foundation; provided, however, that such designation shall not be required for an applicant
115 that provides support to law enforcement state wide. Such application shall be prescribed
116 by the commissioner and shall include an agreement by the applicant to fully comply with
117 the terms and conditions of this Code section.
118 (e)(1) Prior to making a contribution to any qualified law enforcement foundation, the
119 taxpayer shall request preapproval by electronically notify notifying the department, in
120 a manner specified by the commissioner, of the total amount of contribution that such
121 taxpayer intends to make to such qualified law enforcement foundation.
122 (2) Within 30 days after receiving a request for preapproval of contributions, the
123 commissioner shall preapprove, deny, or prorate requested amounts on a first come, first
124 served basis and shall provide notice to such taxpayer and the qualified law enforcement
125 foundation of such preapproval, denial, or proration. Such notices shall not require any
126 signed release or notarized approval by the taxpayer. The preapproval of contributions
127 by the commissioner shall be based solely on the availability of tax credits subject to the
128 limits established under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code section.

129 (3) Within 60 days after receiving the preapproval notice issued by the commissioner
130 pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the taxpayer shall contribute the preapproved
131 amount to the qualified law enforcement foundation or such preapproved contribution
132 amount shall expire. The commissioner shall not include such expired amounts in
133 determining the remaining amount amounts available under the aggregate limit limits
134 provided in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code section for the respective
135 calendar year.
136 (f)(1) Each qualified law enforcement foundation shall issue to each contributor making

138 which shall include the taxpayer's name, address, tax identification number, the amount
139 of the qualified contribution, the date of the qualified contribution, and the total amount
140 of the credit allowed to the taxpayer.
141 (2) In order for a taxpayer to claim the tax credit allowed under this Code section, all
142 such applicable letters as provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be attached
143 to the taxpayer's tax return. When the taxpayer files an electronic return such
144 confirmation shall only be required to be electronically attached to the return if the
145 Internal Revenue Service allows such attachments to be affixed and transmitted to the
146 department. In any such event, the taxpayer shall maintain such confirmation and such
147 confirmation shall only be made available to the commissioner upon request.
148 (3) The commissioner shall allow tax credits for any preapproved contributions made to
149 a local qualified law enforcement foundation at the time the contributions were made if
150 such foundation was a qualified law enforcement foundation at the time of the
151 commissioner's preapproval of the contributions and the taxpayer has otherwise complied
152 with this Code section.
153 (4)(A) For the period beginning on July 1 and ending on December 31 of each year,
154 to the extent that the aggregate amount of tax credits authorized by subsection (b) of
155 this Code section has not been reached, the commissioner shall preapprove, deny, or
- 6 -

AM 50 0118
156 prorate additional requested amounts on a first come, first served basis and shall
157 provide notice to such taxpayer and the qualified law enforcement foundation of such
158 preapproval, denial, or proration.
159 (B) A taxpayer that is preapproved for the tax credit allowed pursuant to this Code
160 section during the period provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall only
161 be allowed such credit in an amount that shall not exceed 95 percent of the amount
162 otherwise allowed pursuant to this Code section.
163 (g)(1) Each qualified law enforcement foundation shall annually submit to the
164 department:
165 (A) A complete copy of its IRS Form 990 and other applicable attachments, or for any
166 qualified law enforcement foundation that is not required by federal law to file an IRS
167 Form 990, such foundation shall submit to the commissioner equivalent information on
168 a form prescribed by the commissioner; and
169 (B) A report detailing the contributions received during the calendar year pursuant to
170 this Code section on a date determined by, and on a form provided by, the
171 commissioner which shall include:
172 (i) The total number and dollar value of individual contributions and tax credits

186 (h) Each qualified law enforcement foundation shall publish on its public website a copy
187 of its affiliated local law enforcement unit's prior year's annual budget containing the total
188 amount of funds received from its local governing body. If a qualified law enforcement
189 foundation does not maintain a public website, such information shall be otherwise made
190 available by the qualified law enforcement foundation to the public upon request.
191 (i)(1) A taxpayer shall not be allowed to designate or direct the taxpayer's qualified
192 contributions to a qualified law enforcement foundation pursuant to this Code section to
193 any particular purpose or for the direct benefit of any particular individual.
194 (2) A taxpayer that operates, owns, is affiliated with, or is a subsidiary of an association,
195 organization, or other entity that contracts directly with a qualified law enforcement
196 foundation or the any local law enforcement unit that is affiliated with a qualified law
197 enforcement foundation shall not be eligible for tax credits allowed under this Code
198 section for contributions made to such qualified law enforcement foundation.
199 (3) In soliciting contributions, no person shall represent or direct that, in exchange for
200 making qualified contributions to any qualified law enforcement foundation, a taxpayer
201 shall receive any direct or particular benefit. The status as a qualified law enforcement
202 foundation shall be revoked for any law enforcement foundation determined to be in
203 violation of this paragraph and shall not be renewed for at least two years.
204 (j)(1) Qualified contributions shall only be used for qualified expenditures. Each
205 qualified law enforcement foundation shall maintain accurate and current records of all
206 expenditures of qualified contributions and provide such records to the commissioner
207 upon his or her request.
208 (2) A qualified law enforcement foundation that fails to comply with any of the
209 requirements under this Code section shall be given written notice by the department of
- 8 -

AM 50 0118
210 such failure to comply by certified mail and shall have 90 days from the receipt of such
211 notice to correct all deficiencies.
212 (3) Upon failure of a qualified law enforcement foundation to correct all deficiencies
213 within 90 days pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the
214 department shall revoke the law enforcement foundation's status as a qualified law
215 enforcement foundation and such entity shall be immediately removed from the
216 department's list of qualified law enforcement foundations. All applications for
217 preapproval of tax credits for contributions to such law enforcement foundation under this
218 Code section made on or after the date of such removal shall be rejected.
219 (4) Each law enforcement foundation that has had its status revoked and has been
220 delisted pursuant to this Code section, shall immediately cease all expenditures of funds
221 received relative to this Code section, and shall transfer all of such funds that are not yet
222 expended, to a properly operating qualified law enforcement foundation within 30
223 calendar days of its removal from the department's list of qualified law enforcement
224 foundations.
225 (k)(1) No credit shall be allowed under this Code section to a taxpayer for any amount
226 of qualified contributions that were utilized as deductions or exemptions from taxable
227 income.
228 (2) In no event shall the total amount of the tax credit under this Code section for a
229 taxable year exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability. Any No unused tax credit shall
230 be allowed the taxpayer against the succeeding three years' tax liability. No such credit
231 shall be allowed the taxpayer against prior years' tax liability.
232 (l) The commissioner shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement and
233 administer the provisions of this Code section."
