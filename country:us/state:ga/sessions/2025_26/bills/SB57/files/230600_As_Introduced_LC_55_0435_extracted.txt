25 LC 55 0435
16 (3) However, when the exercise of this freedom of association by businesses that provide
17 essential goods and services would threaten the ability of citizens of this state to freely
18 exercise their own constitutional rights, it is imperative that the General Assembly act to

20 protected therein are preserved for the citizens of this state;
21 (4) The ability to obtain financial and utility services is essential to the citizens of this

26 at an extreme disadvantage in carrying out the duties of daily life and would deprive such
27 citizens of the enjoyment of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and
28 (7) It is, therefore, incumbent on the General Assembly to preserve the ability of the
29 citizens of this state to obtain financial and utility services by prohibiting financial
30 institutions and utility service providers from depriving such citizens the provision of
31 such services based on such citizens' lawful exercise of their constitutional rights.
