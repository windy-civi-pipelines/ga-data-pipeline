25 LC 52 0596
40 "(a) The State Board of Education shall designate the specific dates upon which two counts
41 of students enrolled in each instructional program authorized under this article shall be
42 made each school year and by which the counts shall be reported to the Department of
43 Education. The initial enrollment count shall be made after October 1 but prior to
44 November 17 and the final enrollment count after March 1 but prior to May 1. The report
45 shall indicate the student's specific assigned program for each one-sixth segment of the
46 school day on the designated reporting date. No program shall be indicated for a student
47 for any one-sixth segment of the school day that the student is assigned to a study hall; a
48 noncredit course; a course recognized under this article or by state board policy as an
49 enrichment course, except a driver education training course; a course which requires
50 participation in an extracurricular activity for which enrollment is on a competitive basis;
51 a course in which the student serves as a student assistant to a teacher, in a school office,
52 or in the media center, except when such placement is an approved work site of a
53 recognized career, technical, and agricultural education laboratory program; an individual
54 study course for which no outline of course objectives is prepared in writing prior to the
55 beginning of the course; or any other course or activity so designated by the state board.
56 For the purpose of this Code section, the term 'enrichment course' means a course which
57 does not dedicate a major portion of the class time toward the development and
58 enhancement of one or more content standards as adopted by the state board under Code
59 Section 20-2-140. A program shall not be indicated for a student for any one-sixth segment
60 of the school day for which the student is not enrolled in an instructional program or has
61 not attended a class or classes within the preceding ten days; nor shall a program be
62 indicated for a student for any one-sixth segment of the school day for which the student
63 is charged tuition or fees or is required to provide materials or equipment beyond those
64 authorized pursuant to Code Section 20-2-133. A student who is enrolled in a dual credit
65 course pursuant to Code Section 20-2-161.3 shall be counted for the high school program

66 or other appropriate program for each segment in which the student is attending such dual
67 credit course. The state board shall adopt such regulations and criteria as necessary to ensure
68 objective and true counts of students in state approved instructional programs. The state
69 board shall also establish criteria by which students shall be counted as resident or
70 nonresident students, including specific circumstances which may include, but not be limited
71 to, students attending another local school system under court order or under the terms of a
72 contract between two local school systems. If a local school system has a justifiable reason,
73 it may seek authority from the state board to shift full-time equivalent program counts from
74 the designated date to a requested alternate date."
75 SECTION 4.
76 Said article is further amended in Code Section 20-2-257, relating to grants for driver
77 education courses for secondary school students, as follows:
78 "20-2-257.
79 The State Board of Education shall provide public secondary schools and local school
80 systems with grants, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly and pursuant to
81 applications made at the discretion of such systems. The purpose of such grants shall be
82 to support motor vehicle driver education training courses and programs for secondary
83 school students. The amount of such grants shall be reflective of the most recent counts
84 of age 15, 16, and 17 year old secondary school students in the public schools or local
85 school systems. The public schools or local school systems receiving such grants may
86 expend these funds only for purposes of providing driver education training courses or
87 programs to secondary school students. Such courses or programs may be provided
88 directly by the local school system or by contract with a private driver education school
89 licensed by the Department of Driver Services. Such grants shall be supplemental to any
90 other provision of state funds for such driver education training courses or programs. The
