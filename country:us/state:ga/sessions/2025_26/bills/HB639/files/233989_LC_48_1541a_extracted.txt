139 health and safety needs of such child may include documentation that:
140 (i) Such child is 14 years of age or older and objects to termination of parental rights.
141 Prior to accepting a child's objection, the court shall personally question such child
142 in chambers to determine whether the objection is a voluntary and knowing choice;
143 (ii) Such child is 16 years of age or older and specifically requests that emancipation
144 be established as his or her permanent plan;

145 (iii) The parent of such child and such child have a significant bond, but such parent
146 is unable to care for such child because of an emotional or physical disability and
147 such child's caregiver has committed to raising such child to the age of majority and
148 facilitating visitation with such disabled parent; or
149 (iv) Such child is in a residential treatment facility that provides services specifically
150 designed to address his or her treatment needs and the court determines that his or her
151 needs could not be served by a less restrictive placement;
152 (C) Such child is living with his or her relative who is unable or unwilling to adopt
153 such child, but who is willing and capable of providing such child with a stable and
154 permanent home environment and the removal of such child from the physical custody
155 of his or her relative would be detrimental to such child's emotional well-being;
156 (D) The court or judicial citizen review panel, in a prior hearing or review, determined
157 that while the case plan was to reunify the family, DFCS did not make reasonable
158 efforts; or
159 (E) Such child is an unaccompanied refugee or there are international legal obligations
160 or foreign policy reasons that would preclude terminating parental rights; or
161 (3) DFCS has not provided to the family of such child services deemed necessary for his
162 or her safe return to his or her home, consistent with the specific time frames for the
163 accomplishment of the case plan goals.
164 (c)(d) The recommendation by DFCS that termination of parental rights is not in the best
165 interests of a child shall be based on the present family circumstances of such child and
166 shall not preclude a different recommendation at a later date if the family circumstances
167 of a child adjudicated as a dependent child change.
168 (d)(e) At least 30 days prior to the fifteenth month a child has been in foster care and when
169 the court deems appropriate, the court shall review DFCS's determination that filing a
170 petition to terminate parental rights would not be in the best interests of such child, as
171 provided for in paragraph (2) of subsection (b) (c) of this Code section. Such hearing may

172 be in conjunction with other matters of the case. At such hearing, the court may appoint
173 an attorney guardian ad litem, who may, after his or her own determination, file a petition
174 to terminate parental rights on behalf of the child. The court in its sole discretion may
175 make any additional rulings."
176 SECTION 6.
177 Said chapter is further amended in Code Section 15-11-310, relating to grounds for
178 determining termination of parental rights, by revising subsection (a) as follows:
179 "(a) In considering the termination of parental rights, the court shall first determine
180 whether one of the following statutory grounds for termination of parental rights has been
181 met:
182 (1) The parent has given written consent to termination which has been acknowledged
183 by the court or has voluntarily surrendered his or her child for adoption;
184 (2) The parent has subjected his or her child to aggravated circumstances;
185 (3) The parent has wantonly and willfully failed to comply for a period of 12 months or
186 longer with a decree to support his or her child that has been entered by a court of
187 competent jurisdiction of this or any other state;
188 (4) A child is abandoned, as such term is defined in Code Section 15-11-2, by his or her
189 parent; or
190 (5) A child is a dependent child due to lack of proper parental care or control by his or
191 her parent, reasonable efforts to remedy the circumstances have been unsuccessful or
192 were not required, such cause of dependency is likely to continue or will not likely be
193 remedied in the reasonably foreseeable future, and:
194 (A) Returning such child to his or her parent is likely to cause serious physical, mental,
195 moral, or emotional harm to such child or threaten the physical safety or well-being of
196 such child; or Continuation of the parent and child relationship will cause or is likely
197 to cause significant physical, mental, moral, or emotional harm to such child; or
H. B. 639
- 8 -

25 LC 48 1541
198 (B) Continuation of the parent and child relationship will cause or is likely to cause
199 serious physical, mental, moral, or emotional harm to such child.
200 (B) In determining harm to the child as required by this subsection, the General
201 Assembly finds that children have a strong biological and psychological need for stable
202 attachment to a trusted adult caregiver, and that lack of such attachment is harmful to
203 the child. Therefore, in considering whether the child will suffer serious physical,
204 mental, moral, or emotional harm under this Code section, the court shall consider:
205 (i) Whether the child is attached to the parent, and the quality of any such attachment;
206 (ii) Whether the child is attached to an alternative caregiver, and the quality of any
207 such attachment;
208 (iii) The psychological needs of the child for secure attachment; and
209 (iv) The danger of further disruptions to the child's attachments."
210 SECTION 7.
211 This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law
212 without such approval and shall apply to all dependency and termination of parental rights
213 cases currently pending, and all such cases later filed, in the juvenile court.
214 SECTION 8.
215 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
