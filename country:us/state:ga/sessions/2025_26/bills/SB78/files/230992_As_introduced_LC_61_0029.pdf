S. B. 78
- 7 -

25 LC 61 0029
168 purpose, and such bonds and all income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation

171 subdivision of the State of Georgia.
172 SECTION 6.
173 Credit not pledged and debt not created by bonds.
174 Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not constitute a debt or a pledge
175 of the faith and credit of the State of Georgia or the City of Tybee Island, but such bonds
176 shall be payable from the rentals, revenue, earnings, and funds of the authority as provided
177 in the resolution or trust agreement or indenture authorizing the issuance and securing the
178 payment of such bonds. The issuance of such bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or
179 contingently obligate the state or said city to levy or pledge any form of taxation for the
180 payment thereof. No holder of any bond or receiver or trustee in connection therewith shall
181 have the right to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state or of said city,
182 nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon
183 any such property. All such bonds shall contain on their face a recital setting forth
184 substantially the foregoing provisions of this section.
185 SECTION 7.

188 agreement or indenture made by the authority with a corporate trustee, which may be any
189 trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State of
190 Georgia. Such trust agreement or indenture may pledge and assign rents, fees, charges,
S. B. 78
- 8 -

25 LC 61 0029
191 revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. The resolution providing for the
192 issuance of revenue bonds and such trust agreement or indenture may contain provisions for
193 protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders, including the right of
194 appointment of a receiver upon default of the payment of any principal or interest obligation
195 and the right of any receiver or trustee to enforce collection of any rents, fees, charges, or
196 revenues for use of the project or projects necessary to pay all costs of operation and all
197 reserves provided for, all principal and interest on all bonds of the issue, all costs of
198 collection, and all other costs reasonably necessary to accomplish the collection of such sums
199 in the event of any default of the authority. Such resolution and such trust agreement or
200 indenture may include covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the
201 acquisition of property for and the construction of the project and to the custody,
202 safeguarding, and application of all funds and covenants providing for the operation,
203 maintenance, repair, and insurance of the project or projects and may contain provisions
204 concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. Such
205 trust agreement or indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of
206 the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in
207 securing bonds and debentures of corporations and may contain such other provisions as the
208 authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses
209 incurred in carrying out such trust may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance,
210 operation, and repair of the project affected by such trust.
211 SECTION 8.
212 Refunding bonds.
213 The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue bonds of the
214 authority for the purpose of calling, refunding, or refinancing any revenue bonds issued
215 under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding and to include in the amount of such
S. B. 78
- 9 -

216 refunding bonds all interest and any call premiums that may be required for the redemption
217 and refunding of such outstanding bonds.
218 SECTION 9.
219 Venue of actions, jurisdiction.
220 Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any action
221 against the authority brought in the courts of the State of Georgia shall be brought in the
222 Superior Court of Chatham County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any
223 bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall be brought in said court, which shall have
224 exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.
225 SECTION 10.
226 Revenue bond validation.
227 The petition for validation of all revenue bonds of the authority shall be brought against the
228 authority, and any contracting party whose obligation is pledged as security for the payment
229 of the bonds sought to be validated, as defendants, and the defendants shall be required to
230 show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof
231 shall not be adjudicated to be in all respects valid and binding upon such contracting parties.
232 It shall be incumbent upon such defendants to defend against adjudication of the validity and
233 binding effect of such contract or contracts or be forever bound thereby. Notice of such
234 proceedings shall be included in the notice of the validation hearing required to be issued and
235 published by the clerk of the Superior Court of Chatham County in which court such
236 validation proceedings shall be initiated.

238 Interest of bondholders protected.
239 While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or
240 existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished,
241 impaired, or affected in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the
242 holders of such bonds. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and
243 the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this
244 Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.

248 construction of the project or projects of the authority with revenue bonds, the authority is

250 which it shall cause to be acquired or constructed. Such rents, fees, or charges to be paid for
251 the use of such project or projects shall be so fixed and adjusted so as to provide a fund
252 sufficient with other revenue, if any, of such project or projects or of the authority:
253 (1) To pay the cost of operating, maintaining, and repairing the project or projects,
254 including reserves for insurance and extraordinary repairs and other reserves required by
255 the resolution or trust agreement or indenture pertaining to such bonds and the issuance
