Honorable Shaw Blackmon
Chairman, House Ways and Means

Atlanta, GA 30334
SUBJECT: Fiscal Note
Dear Chairman Blackmon:
The bill would provide a personal income tax rebate of a portion of tax year 2023 income taxes paid,
subject to filing of a 2024 income tax return in the state. The rebate would be $250 for those filing as
single or married filing separate, $375 for head of household, and $500 for a couple filing jointly. The
amount cannot exceed a filer’s 2023 income taxes paid. Rebates for part-year or nonresident filers
would be prorated using the ratio of income subject to Georgia taxation to total income.
To qualify for the rebate, a taxpayer must have timely filed a Georgia income tax return for both TY
2023 and TY 2024 and cannot have been claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer’s federal or state
tax return for TY 2023. Estates and trusts are also excluded.
Impact on State Revenue
Georgia State University’s Fiscal Research Center (FRC) estimated that the bill would have a one-time
cost of approximately $1.177 billion. It is expected that 90 percent or more of the payments would occur
in FY25, though the timing depends on the date of enactment and the ability of DOR to process
payments are tax returns are filed. Details of the FRC analysis are included in the appendix.
Impact on State Expenditures
The Department of Revenue would be able to implement the bill with existing resources.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin Richard Dunn, Director

Analysis by the Fiscal Research Center
The subject bill proposes to provide a personal income tax rebate of a portion of tax year (TY) 2023
income taxes paid, subject to filing of a 2024 income tax return in the state. The rebate will be $250 for
those filing as single or married filing separate, $375 for head of household, and $500 for a couple filing
jointly, but in no case more than the filer’s 2023 income taxes paid. For part-year and nonresident
filers, the rebate would be prorated using the ratio of income subject to Georgia taxation to total income
as reported on Schedule 3 of the filer’s TY 2023 Georgia tax return.
To qualify for the rebate, a taxpayer must have timely filed a Georgia income tax return for both TY
2023 and TY 2024, and cannot have been claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer’s federal or state
tax return for TY 2023. Estates and trusts are also excluded.
Estimation was done using TY 2021 and TY 2022 administrative tax return data from the Department
of Revenue (DOR) to simulate tax liability under 2023 law as well as the rebate for which the filer would
be eligible based on 2023 tax paid. The aggregate amount of net rebate payments resulting from the
simulation on TY 2021 data are further adjusted assuming an increase in filers of 1.9 percent per year to
TY 2023, the average rate of growth in returns filed in CY’s 2019–23, according to the DOR Annual
Statistical Report for FY 2023.
Payment of the rebates are expected to be made primarily during FY 2025, though the timing would
depend on the final date of enactment and DOR’s ability to validate and process the payments after
returns are filed. The remaining rebates, likely as much as 10 percent based on the timing of payments
of previous rebates, would be paid in FY 2026, though for filers receiving filing extensions for TY 2023
or TY 2024, rebate payments would be delayed until those returns are filed and processed.
The estimated aggregate cost of these one-time rebates is $1,177 million.
