94 information provided for in this subsection may be viewed;
95 (iv) A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed
96 by a law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the provisions of this Code section
97 stating that, based upon inspection of recorded images, the owner's motor vehicle was

112 shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
113 (E) Liability under this paragraph shall be determined based upon a preponderance of

25 LC 39 4663
118 vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such inference may be rebutted if the
119 owner of the motor vehicle:
120 (i) Testifies under oath in open court or submits to the court a sworn notarized
121 statement that he or she was not the operator of the motor vehicle at the time of the
122 alleged violation;
123 (ii) Presents evidence in court that demonstrates he or she is not the owner of the
124 motor vehicle in the recorded images nor rented the motor vehicle in the recorded
125 images; or
126 (iii) Presents to the court a certified copy of a police report showing that the motor
127 vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged
128 violation.
129 (F) Except in cases where an adjudication that no violation occurred has been issued
130 or there is an otherwise lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be
131 imposed:
132 (i) When an owner fails to complete the transit lane safety course or pay the civil
133 monetary penalty for which citation and notice was sent to the owner pursuant to this
134 paragraph within 60 days such notice was mailed, or has failed to submit
135 documentation to the court pursuant to subparagraph (E) of this paragraph, the law
136 enforcement agency or agent thereof which sent the original citation shall send a
137 second notice. Such second notice shall include all information required of the
138 original citation and a new date by which the civil monetary penalty shall be paid
139 which shall be no less than 30 days after such mailing. If such owner notified by
140 second notice again fails to complete the transit lane safety course, pay the civil
141 monetary penalty, or submit documentation to the court pursuant to subparagraph (E)
142 of this paragraph by the new date by which the civil monetary penalty shall be paid,
143 such owner shall have waived the right to contest the violation and shall be liable for
144 the civil monetary penalty provided for under this paragraph; and

25 LC 39 4663
145 (ii) When a citation issued pursuant to this paragraph has not been contested, the
146 transit lane safety course has not been completed, or the civil monetary penalty has
147 not been paid, the agent or governing authority shall mail a second notice of any
148 unpaid civil monetary penalty to the owner.
149 (G) Notices mailed by first-class mail shall be adequate notification of the
150 requirements, fees, and penalties imposed by this paragraph.

152 shall have jurisdiction over cases arising under this paragraph and shall be authorized
153 to impose the civil monetary penalty provided by this paragraph. Except as otherwise
154 provided to the contrary, the provisions of law governing jurisdiction, procedure,
155 defenses, adjudication, appeal, and payment and distribution of penalties otherwise
156 applicable to traffic violations within the city shall apply to enforcement under this
157 article; provided, however, that any appeal from a superior or state court shall be by
158 application in the same manner as that provided by Code Section 5-6-35.
159 (I) Money collected and remitted to the city pursuant to this paragraph shall be remitted
160 to the authority to be used to fund public safety initiatives. This subparagraph shall not
161 preclude the appropriation of a greater amount than collected and remitted by the
162 authority pursuant to this paragraph for such purposes.
163 (J) Any agreement entered into between the governing body of the city or law
164 enforcement agency and an agent for the administration of this paragraph shall be
165 established upon a subscription basis and subject to approval by the department. No
166 such agreement shall authorize any agent to collect or retain a percentage of the civil
167 monetary penalties assessed. Shall agreement shall require the maintenance of recorded
168 images in a system compliant with security and privacy standards set forth by the
169 Georgia Crime Information Center Council for criminal justice information systems.

176 (K) In order to enforce the provisions of this paragraph, the city and authority shall
177 erect signs warning of the use of an automated transit vehicle lane monitoring device
178 no closer than 200 feet and no farther than 500 feet prior to any signalized entrance to
179 a transit vehicle lane. Any such sign shall be at least 24 by 30 inches in size and be
180 placed in such a manner that the sign is plainly visible from every lane of traffic and
181 viewable in all traffic conditions. Any such sign shall indicate whether the automated
182 transit lane monitoring device is fixed upon the roadway or located upon the transit
183 vehicles utilizing the lane or lanes.
184 (L) Any district attorney, solicitor-general of state court, or prosecuting attorney of
185 municipal court whose jurisdiction includes the city shall be authorized to prosecute
186 civil actions to enforce any civil penalty set forth in this paragraph.
187 (3) For a period of six months after the date a transit vehicle lane is designated as such,
188 any violation of this Code section shall be punishable only by issuance of a warning.
189 After six months from the date a transit vehicle lane is designated, all provisions of this
190 Code section regarding such violations shall be in full force and effect.

194 Code section if a uniform traffic citation for the same act has been issued pursuant to
195 Code Section 32-9-4.
196 (d) The department, in consultation with the city, shall be authorized to promulgate
197 appropriate rules and regulations for the implementation of the provisions of this Code

199 The city and the authority in the utilization of such transit vehicle lanes shall at all times
200 cooperate fully with the department. The department shall be authorized, at any time, to

202 or agent thereof on any such transit vehicle lane and any records pertaining to revenues
203 collected from the use of such devices in such lanes. Certified peace officers of the
204 Georgia State Patrol and the Department of Public Safety shall be nonexclusively
205 authorized to enforce the provisions of this Code section.
206 (e) No violation of the provisions of this Code section shall be punished by any term of

118 vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such inference may be rebutted if the
119 owner of the motor vehicle:

122 alleged violation;

126 (iii) Presents to the court a certified copy of a police report showing that the motor
127 vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged

130 or there is an otherwise lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be
131 imposed:
132 (i) When an owner fails to complete the transit lane safety course or pay the civil
133 monetary penalty for which citation and notice was sent to the owner pursuant to this
134 paragraph within 60 days such notice was mailed, or has failed to submit

138 original citation and a new date by which the civil monetary penalty shall be paid

143 such owner shall have waived the right to contest the violation and shall be liable for
144 the civil monetary penalty provided for under this paragraph; and
