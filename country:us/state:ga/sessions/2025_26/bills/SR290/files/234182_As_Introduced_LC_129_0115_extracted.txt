Senate Resolution 290
the 2nd, Esteves of the 35th and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing the need for culturally competent risk assessment tools, targeted public health
2 initiatives, and enhanced healthcare interventions; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, South Asian Americans are disproportionately affected by atherosclerotic
4 cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), commonly known as heart disease, which manifests earlier
5 in life, often before the age of 50, and in a more aggressive manner than in other populations;
6 and
7 WHEREAS, this increased risk of ASCVD is closely linked to a higher prevalence of type-2
8 diabetes among South Asian Americans, underscoring the urgent need for targeted research
9 and intervention within the State of Georgia; and
10 WHEREAS, risk assessment plays a fundamental role in reducing the incidence of heart
11 disease, yet existing risk assessment algorithms are not developed based on data from South
12 Asian Americans, failing to differentiate between native and migrant populations and
13 masking critical health disparities among South Asian subgroups; and

25 LC 129 0115
14 WHEREAS, the absence of population-specific risk assessment tools results in inaccurate
15 estimations of cardiovascular disease risk for South Asian Americans, leading to gaps in
16 prevention, early detection, and treatment; and
17 WHEREAS, it is essential to develop and implement appropriate screening and management
18 strategies for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in South Asian Americans, taking into
19 account hereditary predisposition, established coronary risk factors, and the impact of
20 lifestyle choices such as diet and physical activity; and
21 WHEREAS, there is a demonstrable need for structured interventions at the state level to
22 promote increased physical activity, encourage healthier dietary habits, and advance early
23 recognition tools to improve cardiovascular outcomes for South Asian Americans; and
24 WHEREAS, improved standards of care, including the incorporation of advanced imaging
25 and other diagnostic tools, are necessary to enhance the identification and management of
26 heart disease within the South Asian American community.
27 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
28 recognize the urgent need for culturally competent risk assessment tools, targeted public
29 health initiatives, and enhanced healthcare interventions to improve outcomes and save lives.
30 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
31 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and the
32 press.
