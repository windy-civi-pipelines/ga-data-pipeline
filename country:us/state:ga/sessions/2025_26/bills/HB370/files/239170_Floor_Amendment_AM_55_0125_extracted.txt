131 retail sale in this state shall submit documentation to the commissioner substantiating
132 compliance with such new federal requirements or standards within 30 days of when
133 compliance with such new federal requirement or standards is mandated. Failure of a
134 vapor product manufacturer to substantiate compliance with such new federal requirements
135 or standards shall be grounds for removal of the manufacturer and its nicotine vapor
136 products from the directory established pursuant to Code Section 48-11-43.
137 (h) The commissioner may by rules and regulations establish a procedure to allow vapor
138 product manufacturers to renew certifications without having to resubmit all the

140 information.
141 48-11-43.
142 (a) The commissioner shall develop and maintain a directory listing all the nicotine vapor
143 products for which a certification has been submitted that complies with this article. Such

145 submitted the certification and may include the status of any marketing authorization,
146 order, or other action of the FDA or any court provided under subsection (b) of Code
147 Section 48-11-42. The commissioner shall make the directory available on the
- 6 -
AM 55 0125
148 department's public website within 14 months of the effective date of this article. The
149 commissioner on at least a monthly basis shall update the directory to correct mistakes,
150 ensure accuracy, and add or remove nicotine vapor products as may be necessary. The
151 commissioner shall establish by rules and regulations a process to provide any vapor
152 product manufacturer that submits a certification pursuant to Code Section 48-11-42 and
153 all licensees notice of the initial publication of the directory and changes made to the
154 directory in the prior month.
155 (b)(1) The commissioner shall provide a vapor product manufacturer with notice of any
156 deficiencies in the submitted certification and an opportunity to cure such deficiencies
157 before removing a nicotine vapor product of such vapor product manufacturer from the
158 directory.
159 (2) The commissioner shall not remove from the directory a nicotine vapor product of
160 such vapor product manufacturer until at least 15 days after the vapor product
161 manufacturer has been given notice of such intended action. Notice shall be sufficient
162 and deemed immediately received by a vapor product manufacturer if the notice is sent
163 either electronically or by facsimile to an email address or facsimile number provided by
164 the vapor product manufacturer in its most recent certification form for such nicotine
165 vapor product.
166 (3) The vapor product manufacturer shall have 15 days from the date of service of the
167 notice of the commissioner's intended action provided pursuant to paragraph (2) of this
168 subsection to cure any deficiencies or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the
169 commissioner that such nicotine vapor product of such vapor product manufacturer
170 should be included in the directory.
171 (4) A determination by the commissioner not to include in or to remove from the
172 directory a nicotine vapor product shall be subject to judicial review in the same manner
173 as is provided by law for judicial review of contested cases under Chapter 13 of Title 50,
174 the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.'

301 received. The superior court shall review the record for errors of law, violation of

303 lawfulness of the procedure, lack of any evidence to support the commissioner's decision,
- 12 -

304 and arbitrariness and abuse of discretion. However, the court shall not substitute its
305 judgment as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact.
306 (f) The cost of such seizure, forfeiture, storage, and destruction shall be borne by the
307 person from whom the nicotine vapor products determined to be contraband are

326 (c) Any vapor product manufacturer whose nicotine vapor products are offered for sale or
327 sold in this state that has not appointed and engaged the services of an agent as required by
328 this Code section shall be deemed to have appointed the Secretary of State as its agent for
329 service of process. The appointment of the Secretary of State as agent shall not satisfy the
- 13 -
AM 55 0125
330 condition precedent required in subsection (a) of this Code section to be included or
331 retained in the directory.
332 48-11-50.
333 Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting the commissioner in the exercise of
334 his or her authority, as provided under Article 1 of this chapter, to suspend or refuse to
335 renew a license for violations of Chapters 13 and 13A of Title 10, Title 16, Title 48, or any

340 Assembly regarding the status of the directory, the nicotine vapor products included in the
341 directory, revenue, and expenditures related to administration of this article, and
342 enforcement activities undertaken pursuant to this article."

345 of this Act in an appropriations Act making specific reference to this Act and shall become
346 effective when funds so appropriated become available for expenditure.

106 (e) The information submitted by the vapor product manufacturer pursuant to
107 paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of this Code section shall be considered confidential

115 to such certification as to any nicotine vapor product, including, but not limited to:
116 (1) Issuance or denial of a marketing authorization or other order by the FDA pursuant
117 to 21 U.S.C. Section 387j;
118 (2) Any other order by the FDA or a court or any action required by the FDA concerning
119 the content or quality of the nicotine used in a nicotine vapor product requiring a vapor
120 product manufacturer to remove such nicotine vapor product from the market either
121 temporarily or permanently;
- 5 -

AM 55 0125
122 (3) Any notice of action taken by the FDA affecting the ability of the nicotine vapor
123 product to be introduced or delivered into interstate commerce for commercial
124 distribution in the United States; or
125 (4) Any other change deemed material by the commissioner pursuant to the rules and
126 regulations.
127 (g) In the event that amendments to 21 U.S.C. Section 387j or subsequent regulations or
128 other official federal guidance issued pursuant to 21 U.S.C. Section 387j change

130 compliant, each vapor product manufacturer of a nicotine vapor product that is sold for
131 retail sale in this state shall submit documentation to the commissioner substantiating
132 compliance with such new federal requirements or standards within 30 days of when
133 compliance with such new federal requirement or standards is mandated. Failure of a
134 vapor product manufacturer to substantiate compliance with such new federal requirements
135 or standards shall be grounds for removal of the manufacturer and its nicotine vapor
136 products from the directory established pursuant to Code Section 48-11-43.
137 (h) The commissioner may by rules and regulations establish a procedure to allow vapor
138 product manufacturers to renew certifications without having to resubmit all the
139 information required by this Code section, if there has not been any change as to such
140 information.
141 48-11-43.
142 (a) The commissioner shall develop and maintain a directory listing all the nicotine vapor
143 products for which a certification has been submitted that complies with this article. Such

145 submitted the certification and may include the status of any marketing authorization,
146 order, or other action of the FDA or any court provided under subsection (b) of Code
147 Section 48-11-42. The commissioner shall make the directory available on the
- 6 -

AM 55 0125
148 department's public website within 14 months of the effective date of this article. The
149 commissioner on at least a monthly basis shall update the directory to correct mistakes,
150 ensure accuracy, and add or remove nicotine vapor products as may be necessary. The
151 commissioner shall establish by rules and regulations a process to provide any vapor
152 product manufacturer that submits a certification pursuant to Code Section 48-11-42 and
153 all licensees notice of the initial publication of the directory and changes made to the
154 directory in the prior month.
155 (b)(1) The commissioner shall provide a vapor product manufacturer with notice of any
156 deficiencies in the submitted certification and an opportunity to cure such deficiencies
157 before removing a nicotine vapor product of such vapor product manufacturer from the
158 directory.
159 (2) The commissioner shall not remove from the directory a nicotine vapor product of
160 such vapor product manufacturer until at least 15 days after the vapor product
161 manufacturer has been given notice of such intended action. Notice shall be sufficient
162 and deemed immediately received by a vapor product manufacturer if the notice is sent
163 either electronically or by facsimile to an email address or facsimile number provided by
164 the vapor product manufacturer in its most recent certification form for such nicotine
165 vapor product.
166 (3) The vapor product manufacturer shall have 15 days from the date of service of the
167 notice of the commissioner's intended action provided pursuant to paragraph (2) of this
168 subsection to cure any deficiencies or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the
169 commissioner that such nicotine vapor product of such vapor product manufacturer
170 should be included in the directory.
171 (4) A determination by the commissioner not to include in or to remove from the
172 directory a nicotine vapor product shall be subject to judicial review in the same manner
173 as is provided by law for judicial review of contested cases under Chapter 13 of Title 50,
174 the 'Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.'

275 (a) Any nicotine vapor products offered for sale or sold in violation of this article are

277 commissioner's agents or employees, or any law enforcement officer of this state if directed
278 by the commissioner to do so.
279 (b) Upon seizure, the person from whom the contraband property was seized, if known,
280 shall be provided with a receipt identifying the contraband property seized and indicating
281 from whom the contraband property was seized and the place of seizure. Such contraband
282 shall be stored pending a hearing and appeal provided for in subsections (d) and (e) of this
283 Code section and thereafter destroyed, if authorized.
284 (c) A copy of the receipt shall be:
285 (1) Filed with the department and shall be a public record open to public inspection; and
286 (2) Posted at the courthouse of the county in which the contraband was seized.

288 the commissioner within ten days from the day of seizure. The commissioner, within 30
289 days of receipt of any such claim, shall afford the claimant a hearing in which to show
290 entitlement to the seized items. The burden of proof at such hearing shall be upon the
291 claimant to establish a claim as to the items seized and to show compliance with or

293 order granting or denying the claim within 30 days from the date of the hearing.

296 copy of the petition for review filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County. The
297 proceedings on the petition for review shall be governed by Chapter 3 of Title 5 except as
298 provided otherwise in this Code section. The appeal shall be based upon the record made
299 before the commissioner. The commissioner shall transmit the record and appropriate
300 documents to the superior court within 30 days after the date the petition for review is
301 received. The superior court shall review the record for errors of law, violation of
302 constitutional or statutory provisions, violation of the statutory authority of the agency,
303 lawfulness of the procedure, lack of any evidence to support the commissioner's decision,
- 12 -

AM 55 0125
304 and arbitrariness and abuse of discretion. However, the court shall not substitute its
305 judgment as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact.
306 (f) The cost of such seizure, forfeiture, storage, and destruction shall be borne by the
307 person from whom the nicotine vapor products determined to be contraband are
308 confiscated.

313 in this state to act as agent for the service of process on whom all process, and any action
314 or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of the enforcement of this article, may
315 be served in any manner authorized by law. Such service shall constitute legal and valid
316 service of process on the vapor product manufacturer. The vapor product manufacturer
317 shall provide the name, address, telephone number, and proof of the appointment and
318 availability of such agent to the commissioner.
319 (b) The vapor product manufacturer shall provide notice to the commissioner 30 days prior
320 to termination of the authority of an agent and shall further provide proof to the satisfaction
321 of the commissioner of the appointment of a new agent no less than five days prior to the
322 termination of an existing agent appointment. In the event an agent terminates an agency
323 appointment, the vapor product manufacturer shall notify the commissioner of the
324 termination within five days and shall include proof to the satisfaction of the commissioner
325 of the appointment of a new agent.
326 (c) Any vapor product manufacturer whose nicotine vapor products are offered for sale or
327 sold in this state that has not appointed and engaged the services of an agent as required by
328 this Code section shall be deemed to have appointed the Secretary of State as its agent for
329 service of process. The appointment of the Secretary of State as agent shall not satisfy the
- 13 -

AM 55 0125
330 condition precedent required in subsection (a) of this Code section to be included or
331 retained in the directory.
332 48-11-50.
333 Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting the commissioner in the exercise of
334 his or her authority, as provided under Article 1 of this chapter, to suspend or refuse to
335 renew a license for violations of Chapters 13 and 13A of Title 10, Title 16, Title 48, or any
336 other provisions of law and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.
337 48-11-51.
338 Starting on January 31 of the first year after the year in which this article becomes
339 effective, and annually thereafter, the commissioner shall provide a report to the General
340 Assembly regarding the status of the directory, the nicotine vapor products included in the
341 directory, revenue, and expenditures related to administration of this article, and
342 enforcement activities undertaken pursuant to this article."
343 SECTION 2.
344 This Act shall become effective only if funds are specifically appropriated for the purposes
345 of this Act in an appropriations Act making specific reference to this Act and shall become
346 effective when funds so appropriated become available for expenditure.
347 SECTION 3.
348 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
