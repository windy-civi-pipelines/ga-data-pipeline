Section 1:
25 LC 112 2925
House Resolution 209
60th, and Glaize of the 67th
A RESOLUTION
1 Urging the Georgia General Assembly to pass LC 46 0977, the Workplace Safety and Heat
2 Protection Act, to ensure critical protections for workers facing extreme heat conditions; and
3 for other purposes.
4 WHEREAS, extreme heat poses severe health risks to workers, including heat exhaustion,
5 heat stroke, and other life-threatening heat-related illnesses, disproportionately affecting
6 employees in high-exposure industries such as agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and
7 warehousing; and
8 WHEREAS, Georgia is experiencing increasingly extreme heat conditions, with an average
9 of 20 more dangerously hot days per year compared to historical averages—a number
10 projected to rise due to climate change, increasing the urgency for legislative action; and
11 WHEREAS, studies show that workers in high-heat conditions are 50 percent more likely
12 to suffer from workplace injuries, and heat-related deaths in the United States have increased
13 by nearly 60 percent over the past two decades, underscoring the escalating dangers of
14 unregulated heat exposure in the workplace; and

25 LC 112 2925
15 WHEREAS, Georgia has over 425,000 workers employed in high-risk industries vulnerable
16 to extreme heat, many of whom are low-income and lack access to sufficient workplace
17 protections, putting their livelihoods and well-being at risk; and
18 WHEREAS, federal regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
19 (OSHA) do not currently provide sufficient mandates to address workplace heat exposure,
20 leaving Georgia workers without adequate safeguards against extreme temperatures; and
21 WHEREAS, failure to pass LC 46 0977 would expose thousands of Georgia workers to
22 preventable heat-related illnesses and fatalities, leading to increased medical costs, lost
23 wages, decreased productivity, and strain on emergency medical services, all of which
24 negatively impact Georgia's economy and workforce; and
25 WHEREAS, implementing a heat illness prevention program, as outlined in LC 46 0977,
26 would provide necessary workplace protections, including access to water, shaded areas,
27 mandatory rest breaks, risk assessments, employee training, and emergency response plans,
28 ensuring the safety and well-being of Georgia's workforce.
29 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
30 the members of this body urge the Georgia General Assembly to swiftly pass LC 46 0977,
31 the Workplace Safety and Heat Protection Act, to protect Georgia's workers from the dangers
32 of extreme heat exposure and to establish Georgia as a national leader in worker safety and
33 well-being.
34 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
35 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
36 Governor, the Commissioner of Labor, and all members of the Georgia General Assembly.
