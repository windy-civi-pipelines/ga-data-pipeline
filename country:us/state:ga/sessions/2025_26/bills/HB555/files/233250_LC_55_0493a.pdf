151 that is owed an outstanding debt or other obligation that is secured by a deed to secure
152 debt, security deed, mortgage, security interest, deed of trust, or other lien upon the

154 (C) Thereafter, any remaining proceeds shall be disbursed to the business enterprise
155 against whom the action for public sale was brought pursuant to this Code section less
156 the costs incurred by the Attorney General or district attorney in bringing such action,
157 including reasonable attorney's fees.
158 (4) The public sale of an interest in residential property pursuant to this Code section
159 shall not extinguish any rights of persons in the property other than the business
160 enterprise against whom the action for public sale was filed pursuant to this Code section,
161 including, without limitation:
162 (A) Any person that is owed an outstanding debt or other obligation that is secured by
163 a deed to secure debt, security deed, mortgage, security interest, deed of trust, or other

165 disbursed pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection; and
