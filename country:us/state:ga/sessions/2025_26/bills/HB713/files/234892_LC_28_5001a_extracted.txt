15 SECTION 2.
16 Chapter 1 of Title 28 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to general
17 provisions regarding the General Assembly, is amended by adding new Code sections to read

19 "28-1-17.
20 (a) No rule, statute, or executive action shall limit the right of members of the General
21 Assembly to introduce, file, or advocate for legislation that represents the interests of their
22 constituents.
23 (b) Any attempt to place a limit on the number of bills or resolutions which a member of

25 legislative process which infringes on the right of elected officials to serve the people
26 without arbitrary limitations.
27 (c) The General Assembly is the direct voice of the people, and no rule, statute, or
28 executive action shall diminish the duty of a member of the General Assembly to introduce
29 policies that address the needs and concerns of his or her constituents.
30 (d) This Code section reaffirms the constitutional principle of representative democracy
31 and that elected members of the General Assembly are sent to the General Assembly to
32 serve the best interests of their districts without restriction or interference that would
33 suppress the will of the voters.
34 (e) Therefore, the rights of members of the General Assembly to freely propose, debate,
35 and pass legislation are critical to ensuring a limited, accountable government that
36 functions on behalf of its citizens and not bureaucratic control.
37 (f) Any attempt to suppress a member of the General Assembly's ability to file and
38 introduce legislation shall be subject to judicial review under both state and federal
39 constitutional protections, and members of the General Assembly shall have standing to
40 challenge any such attempt in court, with legal representation to be provided by the
41 Legislative Constitutional Counsel's Office.
