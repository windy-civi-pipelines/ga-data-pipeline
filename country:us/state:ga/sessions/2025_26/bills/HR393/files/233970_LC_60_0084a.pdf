68th, Drenner of the 85th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Urging the General Assembly to enact the Workplace Safety and Heat Protection Act
2 (LC 46 0977) to safeguard workers from extreme heat conditions that endanger their health
3 and economic security; and for other purposes.
4 WHEREAS, Georgia workers, particularly those in the construction, manufacturing,
5 agriculture, transportation, and warehousing sectors, are increasingly exposed to extreme
6 heat conditions due to rising temperatures and required outdoor exposure; and
7 WHEREAS, prolonged exposure to high temperatures has been linked to serious health risks,
8 including heat exhaustion, heat stroke, cardiovascular strain, and even fatality,
9 disproportionately impacting workers in physically demanding jobs; and
10 WHEREAS, the current lack of enforceable workplace heat protection standards exacerbates
11 economic vulnerabilities, as work absences due to heat related illness result in loss of wages,
12 financial instability, and increased healthcare costs for workers and their families; and
13 WHEREAS, according to economic studies, workplace injuries and illnesses from extreme
14 heat result in significant productivity losses, increased workers' compensation claims, and

15 a reduced labor force, which cumulatively harm Georgia's economic growth and
16 competitiveness; and
17 WHEREAS, labor unions and advocacy organizations have emphasized the necessity of
18 comprehensive heat protection policies, including mandated rest breaks, access to hydration,
19 cooling stations, and employer provided protective measures to mitigate heat related hazards;
20 and
21 WHEREAS, similar protections adopted in other states have demonstrated that workplace
22 safety measures not only improve worker health but also bolster economic stability and
23 reduce the burden on healthcare and social safety nets.
24 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
25 the members of this body urge the General Assembly to enact the Workplace Safety and Heat
26 Protection Act (LC 46 0977) to establish enforceable workplace heat protection standards,
27 including, but not limited to:
28 (1) Defining extreme heat conditions as workplace conditions with a heat index
29 exceeding 80 degrees Fahrenheit or other thresholds as determined by the federal
30 Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as of January 1, 2025; and
31 (2) Requiring employers to implement a heat illness prevention program designed to
32 mitigate heat related risks through prevention, training, and emergency responses for
33 employees working in extreme heat conditions.
34 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
35 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
36 Governor, the Commissioner of Labor, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, and all members
37 of the Georgia General Assembly.
