91 person filling in the rest of the application shall sign such person's name below it as a
92 witness.
93 (G) Any elector meeting criteria of advanced age or disability specified by rule or
94 regulation of the State Election Board or any elector who is entitled to vote by absentee

98 and for a primary as well as for any runoffs resulting therefrom and for the election for
99 which such primary shall nominate candidates as well as any runoffs resulting

101 paragraph, a separate and distinct application shall be required for each primary, run-off
102 primary, election, and run-off election. Except as otherwise provided in this
103 subparagraph paragraph, a separate and distinct application for an absentee ballot shall

105 (H)(i) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an elector may request
106 to receive absentee ballots for all future regularly scheduled primaries, elections, and
107 runoffs in which such elector is eligible to vote. Each absentee ballot application
108 prepared by the Secretary of State for electors to use to request an absentee ballot
109 shall contain a place for the elector to select such option. If an elector selects such
110 option, it shall not be necessary for such elector to make subsequent application for
111 an absentee ballot for regularly scheduled primaries, elections, and runoffs unless:
112 (I) The elector is moved to the inactive list of electors as prescribed by Code
113 Section 21-2-235; provided, however, that, if an elector returns a confirmation
114 notice pursuant to Code Section 21-2-234 and verifies or updates his or her address
115 inside this state, the address to which the elector's absentee ballot is mailed shall
116 likewise be verified or updated; or
117 (II) The elector opts out of receiving absentee ballots without having to make an
118 application as provided in this Code section.
119 (ii) Whether or not an elector has selected the option to receive absentee ballots for
120 all future regularly scheduled primaries, elections, and runoffs in which such elector
121 is eligible to vote shall be included in the data collected and maintained on electors
122 by the Secretary of State and available for public inspection pursuant to Code
123 Section 21-2-225."
