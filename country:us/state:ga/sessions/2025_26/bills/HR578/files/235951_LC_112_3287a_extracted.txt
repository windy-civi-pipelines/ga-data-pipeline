House Resolution 578
III of the 26th, and Kelley of the 16th
A RESOLUTION
1 Commending the Sport Fish Restoration Program as part of the American System of
2 Conservation Funding upon its 75th anniversary; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, more than a century ago, hunters and anglers were among the first
4 conservationists to recognize that America's natural resources were in peril and could not
5 sustain unregulated harvest and habitat destruction; and
6 WHEREAS, sportsmen and women took it upon themselves to support laws that stopped
7 excessive harvesting of fish and wildlife; established state agencies to protect fish, wildlife,
8 and their habitat; and supported special fishing and hunting license fees to help fund these
9 agencies' efforts to provide healthy natural resources for future generations; and
10 WHEREAS, upon realizing that license fees alone were insufficient to restore and sustain
11 healthy fish populations, anglers supported excise taxes on fishing equipment to raise
12 additional funds to support restoration and enhancement efforts of state agencies; and
13 WHEREAS, the Sport Fish Restoration Program, which began 75 years ago with the passage
14 of the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act in 1950 and was further expanded with the
H. R. 578
- 1 -
25 LC 112 3287
15 Wallop-Breaux amendment to the Sport Fish Restoration Act in 1984, is a vital part of
16 conservation funding in the United States; and
17 WHEREAS, a manufacturers' excise tax on fishing equipment, along with an excise tax on
18 motorboat and small engine fuels, is primarily distributed back to the states through the
19 United States Fish and Wildlife Service for fisheries conservation, management, and angler
20 and boater access; and
21 WHEREAS, this cooperative partnership between the sportfishing industry, anglers, boaters,
22 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and state natural resource agencies has resulted
23 in the most successful model of fisheries management in the world, restoring and enhancing
24 populations across the United States and its territories; and
25 WHEREAS, since 1939, the combined contribution of the Wildlife and Sport Fish
26 Restoration Programs and license fees to state fish and wildlife agencies has exceeded $78
27 billion—more than any other single conservation effort in American history—collectively
28 constituting the American System of Conservation Funding.
29 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
30 the members of this body commend America's anglers and boaters, the sportfishing industry,
31 state fish and wildlife agencies, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for their
32 leading role in restoring healthy populations of fish and aquatic resources, both game and
33 non-game, to the abundance seen today through the Sport Fish Restoration Program, in this
34 the 75th anniversary year of the program's establishment as part of the American System of
35 Conservation Funding.
