of the 87th, Scott of the 76th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the House Study Committee on the Cumulative Impact of Pollution on Economic
2 Development and Growth; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, pollution negatively impacts the health of a community and its economic
4 prospects, thus furthering cycles of poverty; and
5 WHEREAS, a concentration of industrial facilities in a community leads to blight and limited
6 amenities that contribute to lower property values and less funding for public schools, also
7 furthering cycles of poverty; and
8 WHEREAS, proximity to a facility that needs a risk management plan is associated with
9 significantly lower home values; and
10 WHEREAS, employers and businesses such as grocery stores, food services, healthcare
11 providers, hotels, and professional service centers prefer to not be located near industrial
12 centers, thus limiting the job prospects for community residents and furthering cycles of
13 poverty; and

14 WHEREAS, Georgia's leading economic engine, agriculture, is put at risk by air, soil, and
15 water pollution that can potentially stunt crop growth and affect both Georgia's economy and
16 the food security of all Georgians; and
17 WHEREAS, in Georgia there are more than 1 million resident anglers who collectively spend
18 8.7 million days a year on the water, and more than 650,000 hunters who collectively spend
19 8.9 million days a year in the field. The combination of these activities accounts for over $2
20 billion in retail sales, $3 billion in ripple effects, and more than 38,000 jobs; this vital
21 economic engine is also put at risk by pollution; and
22 WHEREAS, conditions such as severe asthma, nervous system damage, cardiovascular
23 disease, dangerous pregnancy outcomes, heart disease, and various forms of cancer can
24 cluster in polluted areas, areas near highways, and areas near industrial plants; addressing the
25 environmental causes of disease is important for the health of communities, but also for the
26 economic prosperity of the state; and
27 WHEREAS, in 2020 the average life expectancy in the United States was 77 years of age,
28 but in Georgia, the average life expectancy was 75.6 years of age, which constitutes the
29 fifteenth worst life expectancy of any state in the nation; and
30 WHEREAS, Georgia tied for second among states with the highest prevalence of childhood
31 asthma in 2021, with 9.7 percent of Georgia's children suffering from the condition, and the
32 total cost of asthma related hospitalizations among Georgia children totaled $41.6 million;

34 WHEREAS, studies have shown that simply reducing heavy-duty truck traffic by half could
35 decrease air quality warning days, thus allowing 16,000 more Georgians to play outside,
36 eliminate 2,700 sick days, and overall provide $200 million in annual economic benefit; and
37 WHEREAS, flooding of infrastructure such as concrete and overburdened storm-water and
38 waste-water systems, which are typically found in highly industrialized areas, is another
39 source of pollution and negative economic impact on communities; and
40 WHEREAS, all citizens of this state should have access to clean air, water, and sustainable
41 infrastructure; and
42 WHEREAS, careful study is necessary to determine policy and legislative solutions for
43 sustainable, economically viable, and healthy communities.
44 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
