3 hardworking families and small businesses; and for other purposes.
4 WHEREAS, the United States has long enjoyed strong trade relationships with Mexico and
5 Canada, which are essential partners under the North American trade framework; and
6 WHEREAS, Georgia has an economy built on agriculture, manufacturing, and small
7 businesses that depend on access to international markets and reasonably priced imported
8 goods; and
9 WHEREAS, the recent threat of tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada threatens to
10 increase costs for Georgia consumers and small business owners alike, creating a heavy
11 burden on hardworking everyday Georgians who already face rising living expenses; and
12 WHEREAS, these tariffs will likely disrupt supply chains, lead to retaliatory trade measures,
13 and negatively impact critical sectors of Georgia's economy, including the agricultural
14 industry, which relies heavily on export markets; and

25 LC 112 2876
15 WHEREAS, Georgia's small business owners, who form the backbone of the state's
16 economy, will be forced to absorb or pass on increased costs to consumers, thereby limiting
17 their ability to grow, hire, and contribute to the economic well-being of their communities;
18 and
19 WHEREAS, imposing these tariffs detracts from addressing critical issues that would
20 improve the quality of life for Georgians, such as strengthening education, improving
21 infrastructure, and expanding access to healthcare.
22 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
23 express their strong disagreement with the broad imposition of tariffs on Mexico and Canada
24 by the President of the United States in recognition of their harmful effects on Georgia's
25 families, small businesses, and economy.
26 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the members of this body urge the federal government
27 to prioritize policies that promote free and fair trade, reduce financial burdens on citizens,
28 and foster a stable environment that supports Georgia's growth and prosperity.
29 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the members of this body stand in support of Georgia's
30 hardworking families, entrepreneurs, and farmers, all of whom are essential to the state's
31 economic success and deserve federal policies that help rather than hinder their ability to
32 thrive.
33 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
34 to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the President of the
35 United States, the United States Trade Representative, and members of Georgia's
36 Congressional Delegation.
