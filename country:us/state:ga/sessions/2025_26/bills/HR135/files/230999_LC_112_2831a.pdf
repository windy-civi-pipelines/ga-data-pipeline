By: Representative Hong of the 103rd
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing February 3, 2025, as Topical Steroid Withdrawal Syndrome Awareness Day at
2 the state capitol; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, Topical Steroid Withdrawal Syndrome (TSWS), also known as Topical Steroid
4 Addiction or Red Skin Syndrome, is a severe and debilitating condition that can arise from
5 intentional or unintentional exposure to topical steroids; and
6 WHEREAS, topical steroids are widely prescribed and available over the counter to treat
7 both acute and chronic skin conditions, including eczema, psoriasis, vitiligo, and alopecia
8 areata; and
9 WHEREAS, TSWS is characterized by severe symptoms such as skin flushing,
10 inflammation, diffuse spreading rashes, profuse skin flaking, and intense burning and itching
11 that often surpass the severity of the original condition, typically manifesting after the use
12 of topical steroids, between treatments, or upon discontinuation; and
13 WHEREAS, recovery from TSWS can take several months to several years, leaving many
14 sufferers bedridden or housebound and unable to work, care for children, or attend school;

16 WHEREAS, the prolonged withdrawal and recovery period can have a profound impact on
17 both physical and mental health, with 81 percent of adults and 56 percent of children
18 experiencing TSWS reporting anxiety or depression and 47 percent of adults and 11 percent
19 of children reporting suicidal ideation; and
20 WHEREAS, the prevalence of topical steroid addiction remains unknown due to a scarcity
21 of published research; and
22 WHEREAS, limited research on TSWS hinders the development of diagnostic criteria; the
23 understanding of its causes, effects, and mechanisms; the establishment of appropriate
24 treatment protocols; and the education of both healthcare providers and patients on TSWS
25 and steroid stewardship; and
26 WHEREAS, a lack of awareness and education about TSWS among both patients and
27 providers can lead to misunderstandings, causing patients to question their providers' medical
28 oversight and leading providers to suspect medication non-compliance or, in some cases,
29 parental neglect; and
30 WHEREAS, all parties would benefit greatly from increased awareness and prevention
31 education on the signs of topical steroid dependence and the risks associated with TSWS.
32 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
33 the members of this body recognize February 3, 2025, as Topical Steroid Withdrawal
34 Syndrome Awareness Day at the state capitol.
