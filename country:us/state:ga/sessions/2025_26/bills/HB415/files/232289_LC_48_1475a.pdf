27 "(a) In all cases when a tenant holds possession of lands or tenements over and beyond the
28 term for which they were rented or leased to such tenant and in all cases when lands or
29 tenements are held and occupied by any tenant at will or sufferance, whether under contract
30 of rent or not, when the owner of such lands or tenements desires possession of such lands
31 or tenements, such owner may, individually or by an agent, attorney at law, or attorney in
32 fact, demand the possession of the property so rented, leased, held, or occupied. If the
33 tenant refuses or fails to deliver possession when so demanded, the owner or the agent,
34 attorney at law, or attorney in fact of such owner may immediately go before the judge of
35 the superior court, the judge of the state court, or the clerk or deputy clerk of either court,
36 or the judge or the clerk or deputy clerk of any other court with jurisdiction over the subject
37 matter, or a magistrate in the district where the land lies and make an affidavit under oath
38 to the facts. The affidavit as provided in Code Section 44-2-4.1 may also be the basis to
39 demand the possession of the property. Such affidavit may likewise be made before a
40 notary public."
