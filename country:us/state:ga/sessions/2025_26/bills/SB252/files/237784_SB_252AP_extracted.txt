17 (b) All such municipalities shall have authority to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of
18 any real or personal property comprising parks, playgrounds, golf courses, swimming
19 pools, or other like property used primarily for recreational purposes, provided that nothing
20 in this Code section shall have the effect of authorizing alienation where such would be in
21 derogation of rights, duties, and obligations imposed by prior deed, contract, or like
22 document of similar import or where such alienation would cause divesting of title to a
23 park, playground, golf course, swimming pool, or other like property that had been
24 dedicated to public use and not subsequently abandoned.
25 (c)(1) All such municipalities shall have authority to lease out and grant easements over
26 property used primarily for recreational purposes to others consistent with general park
27 and recreational purposes for a period not exceeding 50 years and for a valuable
28 consideration. Any such recreational property which was formerly used for annual
29 regional fair purposes but is no longer so used may be leased by any such municipality
30 to one or more private entities for terms of not more than 50 years each for development
31 and use as motion picture and television production, processing, and related facilities
32 together with all such support and service facilities as are necessary or convenient to such
33 use.
34 (2) All such municipalities shall have authority to enter into contracts and renewals and
35 extensions of contracts for the cooperative operation, maintenance, cooperative
36 management, and funding of property which in no way limits the governance or the
37 policy role of said municipalities which property is used primarily for recreational
38 purposes consistent with general park and recreational purposes, for periods not
39 exceeding ten years and for a valuable consideration.
40 (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this Code section, all such
41 municipalities shall have authority to lease out, grant easements over, or convey any
42 property described in subsection (b) of this Code section to an independent school system
43 operating in such municipality for a valuable consideration where the governing authority

44 of such municipality and the board of such independent school system determine that
45 such lease, easement, or conveyance is in the best interest of their respective jurisdictions
46 and for use of the school system for educational purposes. If such property is conveyed,
47 the governing authority of such municipality shall subsequently replace such property
48 with one or more properties which are determined by such governing authority to be, in
49 the aggregate, of equal or greater acreage and of substantially equivalent or greater
50 benefit to the citizens of such municipality, taking into consideration the prevailing uses
51 and needs of such municipality. One or more independent conveyances of property as
52 may be agreed upon by such municipality and independent school system for the public
53 uses set forth in subsection (b) of this Code section shall be credited against the
54 replacement property required by this paragraph for any subsequent conveyance of
55 property described in subsection (b) of this Code section by the municipality to the
56 independent school system. The cumulative impact of such conveyances shall not result
57 in a net loss of park acreage owned by such municipality."
58 SECTION 2.
59 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
