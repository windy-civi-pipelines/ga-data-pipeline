66 and continuing eligibility of such person for such exemption; provided, however, that any

69 exemption for that same homestead property in the 2026 tax year shall be automatically
70 allowed the exemption granted under subsection (b) of this section for that homestead
71 without further application. The tax commissioner shall provide application forms for this
72 purpose.
73 (d) The exemption shall be claimed and returned as provided in Code Section 48-5-50.1

76 section occupies the residence as a homestead. After such person has filed the proper
77 application as provided in subsection (c) of this section, it shall not be necessary to make
78 application thereafter for any year, and such exemption shall continue to be allowed to such

93 (3) The homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall not be
94 applied in addition to any other base year value homestead exemption provided by law
95 with respect to the Bryan County school district. In any such event, the Bryan County
96 tax commissioner shall apply only the base year value homestead exemption that is larger
97 or more beneficial for the taxpayer with respect to the Bryan County school district.
98 (f) For the purposes of this section, the Bryan County tax commissioner shall promulgate
99 a standardized method for determining annual inflationary index rates which reflect the
100 effects of inflation and deflation on the cost of living for residents of Bryan County for a
101 given calendar year. Such method may utilize the Consumer Price Index as reported by the
102 Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor or any other similar
103 index established by the federal government if the Bryan County tax commissioner
104 determines that such federal index fairly reflects the effects of inflation and deflation on
105 residents of the Bryan County school district.
106 (g) The exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall apply to all taxable years
107 beginning on or after January 1, 2026.

115 school district for approval or rejection. The election superintendent shall conduct that

127 All persons desiring to vote for approval of the Act shall vote "Yes," and all persons desiring
128 to vote for rejection of the Act shall vote "No." If more than one-half of the votes cast on

137 section, any elector of the Bryan County school district may apply for a writ of mandamus
138 to compel the election superintendent to perform his or her duties under this section. If the
139 court finds that the election superintendent has not complied with this section, the court shall
140 fashion appropriate relief requiring the election superintendent to call and conduct such
141 election on the date required by this section or on the next date authorized for special
142 elections provided for in Code Section 21-2-540 of the O.C.G.A.
