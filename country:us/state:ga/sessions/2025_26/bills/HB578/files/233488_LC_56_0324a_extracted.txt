15 "(a)(1)(A)(i) Unless exempt, the telephone subscriber of any telephone service shall
16 be billed for the monthly 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to such telephone
H. B. 578

17 service by the service supplier. Beginning on July 1, 2025, such 9-1-1 charge shall
18 be $3.00 Such 9-1-1 charge shall be $1.50 per month per telephone service provided
19 to the telephone subscriber except as reduced pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection
20 (d) of this Code section.
21 (ii) In computing the amount due under this subsection, the number of 9-1-1 charges
22 a telephone subscriber shall be assessed shall not exceed the number of simultaneous
23 outbound calls that can be made from voice channels the service supplier has
24 activated and enabled. For telephone service that provides to multiple locations
25 shared simultaneous outbound voice channel capacity configured to and capable of
26 accessing a 9-1-1 system in different states, the monthly 9-1-1 charge shall be
27 assessed only for the portion of such shared voice channel capacity in this state as
28 identified by the service supplier's books and records. In determining the portion of
29 shared capacity in this state, a service supplier may rely on, among other factors, a
30 customer's certification of its allocation of capacity in this state, which may be based
31 on each end user location, the total number of end users, and the number of end users
32 at each end user location.
33 (B) All telephone services billed to federal, state, or local governments shall be exempt
34 from the 9-1-1 charge. Each service supplier shall, on behalf of the local government,
35 collect the 9-1-1 charge from those telephone subscribers to whom it provides
36 telephone service in the area served by the emergency 9-1-1 system. As part of its
37 normal billing process, the service supplier shall collect the 9-1-1 charge for each
38 month a telephone service is in service, and it shall list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate
39 entry on each bill. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require a service
40 supplier to list the 9-1-1 charge as a surcharge or separate entry on each bill. Service
41 suppliers that do not list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill shall remit the
42 9-1-1 charge for each telephone subscriber that pays the bill; provided, however, that
43 this information shall be maintained in a form auditors can access. If a service supplier
H. B. 578
- 2 -
25 LC 56 0324
44 receives a partial payment for a bill from a telephone subscriber, the service supplier
45 shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber owes the service
46 supplier first.
47 (C) This paragraph shall not apply to wireless service or prepaid wireless service or the
48 telephone subscribers or service suppliers of such services.
49 (2)(A) If the governing body of a local government operates or contracts for the
50 operation of a public safety answering point that is capable of providing or provides
51 automatic number identification of a wireless telecommunications connection and the
52 location of the base station or cell site which receives a 9-1-1 call from a wireless
53 telecommunications connection, the subscriber of a wireless telecommunications
54 connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is served by
55 the local government or that would be served by the local government for the purpose
56 of such a public safety answering point may be billed for the monthly wireless
57 enhanced 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to that connection by the wireless
58 service supplier. Beginning on July 1, 2025, such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge shall
59 be $3.00 Such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge shall be $1.50 per month per wireless
60 telecommunications connection provided to the telephone subscriber except as
61 otherwise provided in paragraph (4) of subsection (d) of this Code section.
62 (B) If the governing body of a local government operates or contracts for the operation
63 of an emergency 9-1-1 system which is capable of providing or provides automatic
64 number identification and automatic location identification of a wireless
65 telecommunications connection, the subscriber of a wireless telecommunications
66 connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is served by
67 the local government or that would be served by the local government for the purpose
68 of such an emergency 9-1-1 system may be billed for the monthly wireless enhanced
69 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to that connection by the wireless service
70 supplier. Such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge may not exceed the amount of the
H. B. 578

71 monthly 9-1-1 charge imposed upon other telephone subscribers pursuant to
72 paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall be imposed on a monthly basis for each
73 wireless telecommunications connection provided to the telephone subscriber.
74 (C) All wireless telecommunications connections billed to federal, state, or local
75 governments shall be exempt from the wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge. Each wireless
76 service supplier shall, on behalf of the local government, collect the wireless enhanced
77 9-1-1 charge from those telephone subscribers whose place of primary use is within the
78 geographic area that is served by the local government or that would be served by the
79 local government for the purpose of such an emergency 9-1-1 system. As part of its
80 normal billing process, the wireless service supplier shall collect the wireless enhanced
81 9-1-1 charge for each month a wireless telecommunications connection is in service,
82 and it may list the wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill.
83 Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require a wireless service supplier
84 to list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill. Wireless service suppliers that
85 do not list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill shall remit the 9-1-1 charge
86 for each telephone subscriber that pays the bill; provided, however, that this
87 information shall be maintained in a form auditors can access. If a wireless service
88 supplier receives partial payment for a bill from a telephone subscriber, the wireless
89 service supplier shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber
90 owes the wireless service supplier first.
91 (D) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the application of any 9-1-1 service charge with
92 respect to a mobile telecommunications service, as defined in 4 U.S.C. Section 124(7),
93 shall be governed by the provisions of Code Section 48-8-6.
94 (E) This paragraph shall not apply to prepaid wireless service or the telephone
95 subscribers or service suppliers of such service."

101 including counties and municipalities that operate multijurisdictional or regional 9-1-1
102 systems or have created a joint authority pursuant to Code Section 46-5-138, are
103 authorized to impose by ordinance or resolution a prepaid wireless 9-1-1 charge in the

107 by ordinance pursuant to this subsection prior to July 1, 2025, shall, beginning on
