25 LC 49 2388S
41 damages brought under the provisions of this chapter, no claimant shall recover a sum
42 exceeding $3 million from any single municipality because of loss arising from a single
43 occurrence; and any single municipality's aggregate liability per occurrence shall not
44 exceed $5 million. The existence of these caps on liability shall not be disclosed or

51 Article IX, Section II, Paragraph IX of the Constitution of the State of Georgia. Any such
52 new waiver must be pled and proven by the claimant as provided by law."
53 SECTION 1-3A.
54 Said chapter is further amended by revising Code Section 36-33-1, relating to immunity from
55 liability for damages, waiver of immunity by purchase of liability insurance, and liability for

57 "36-33-1.
58 (a) Pursuant to Article IX, Section II, Paragraph IX of the Constitution of the State of
59 Georgia, the General Assembly, except as provided in this Code section and in Chapter 92
60 of this title, declares it is the public policy of the State of Georgia that there is no waiver
61 of the sovereign immunity of municipal corporations of the state and such municipal
62 corporations shall be immune from liability for damages. A municipal corporation shall
63 not waive its immunity by the purchase of liability insurance, except as provided in Code
64 Section 33-24-51 or 36-92-2, or unless the policy of insurance issued covers an occurrence
65 for which the defense of sovereign immunity is available, and then only to the extent of the
66 limits of such insurance policy. This subsection shall not be construed to affect any
- 3 -

25 LC 49 2388S
67 litigation pending on July 1, 1986. In addition to the waivers of a municipal corporation's
68 immunity as provided by Code Sections 33-24-51 and 36-92-2, a municipal corporation
69 shall waive its immunity by the purchase of liability insurance if the policy of insurance
70 covers an occurrence and then only to the extent of the limits of the insurance policy. It
71 shall be against public policy, void, and unenforceable for a contract for liability insurance
72 to attempt to avoid the effect of this waiver of immunity, or any other waiver of a
73 municipal corporation's immunity. Among other things, the duty to pay damages on behalf
74 of a municipality must be determined under the policy of insurance without consideration
75 of whether immunity would otherwise exist for those damages.
76 (b) Municipal corporations shall not be liable for failure to perform or for errors in
77 performing their legislative or judicial powers. For neglect to perform or improper or
78 unskillful performance of their ministerial duties, they shall be liable."
79 PART II
80 SECTION 2-1.
81 Chapter 80 of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to general

84 immigration sanctuary policies by local governmental entities, and certification of
85 compliance, to read as follows:
86 "(f) In the event that a local governing body acts in violation of this Code section, the
87 sovereign immunity of such local governing body and the governmental immunity of all
88 local officials and employees of such local governing body is waived in all matters arising
89 from or resulting in the violation of this Code section."
