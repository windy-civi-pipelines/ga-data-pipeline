Section 1:
LC 52 0862S
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the House Study Committee on Evaluating Funding for Public Health; and for other
2 purposes.
3 WHEREAS, Georgia's health security and financial well-being depend on a growing, fully
4 funded state and local public health system; and
5 WHEREAS, as the former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop once said, "Health care
6 is vital to all us some of the time, but public health is vital to all of us all of the time"; and
7 WHEREAS, increases in public health spending have been shown to reduce preventable
8 deaths, and healthier communities support stronger economies; and
9 WHEREAS, public health has historically been underfunded, specifically when compared
10 with healthcare. In fact, less than one in every ten state general fund dollars spent on
11 Georgia's three primary health agencies goes to the Department of Public Health; and
12 WHEREAS, additional support may be necessary to shape a state public health budget that
13 contributes to a sustainable public health infrastructure; and
