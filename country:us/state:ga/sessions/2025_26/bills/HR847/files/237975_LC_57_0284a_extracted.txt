House Resolution 847
of the 158th, Stephens of the 164th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the House Study Committee on Evaluating Funding for Public Health; and for other
2 purposes.
3 WHEREAS, Georgia's health security and financial well-being depend on a growing, fully
4 funded state and local public health system; and
5 WHEREAS, as the former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop once said, "Health care
6 is vital to all us some of the time, but public health is vital to all of us all of the time"; and
7 WHEREAS, according to the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, increases in public health
8 spending have been shown to reduce preventable deaths, and healthier communities support
9 stronger economies; and
10 WHEREAS, according to such Institute, public health has historically been underfunded,
11 specifically when compared with healthcare. In fact, less than one in every ten state general
12 fund dollars spent on Georgia's three primary health agencies goes to the Department of
13 Public Health; and
