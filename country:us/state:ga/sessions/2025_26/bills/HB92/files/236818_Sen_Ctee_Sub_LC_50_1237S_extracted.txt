22 amended in Code Section 48-5-2, relating to definitions relative to ad valorem taxation of
23 property, by revising paragraph (2.1) as follows:
24 "(2.1) 'Estimated roll-back rate' means, for any given levying or recommending authority,
25 the current year's estimated millage rate for general maintenance and operations minus
26 the millage equivalent of the total net assessed value added by reassessments:
27 (A) As as calculated and certified to the tax commissioner by the levying or
28 recommending authority pursuant to Code Section 48-5-306.2 for county and
29 educational tax purposes; and
30 (B) As calculated and certified to the collecting officer of the municipality by the

33 Said title is further amended in Code Section 48-5-34, relating to ad valorem property tax bill
34 form, by revising subsection (b) and adding a new subsection to read as follows:
35 "(b) In addition to the requirements of subsection (a) of this Code section, regarding any
36 ad valorem property tax bill where if the millage rate adopted by a tax taxing authority
37 exceeds the estimated roll-back rate and such estimated roll-back rate was provided in the
38 annual notice of assessment, such tax bill shall include a notice containing the name of
39 such taxing authority and the following statement in bold print:
- 2 -

25 LC 50 1237S
40 'The adopted millage rate exceeds the estimated roll-back rate as stated in the annual
41 notice of assessment that you previously received for this taxable year, which will
42 result in an increase in the amount of property tax that you will owe.'
43 (c)(1) If the governing authority of a county, consolidated government, municipality, or
44 school district elected to opt out of the homestead exemption provided for in Code
45 Section 48-5-44.2 and there is not in effect for such political subdivision a base year
46 value homestead exemption or adjusted base year value homestead exemption that is
47 generally applicable for homestead residents, each ad valorem property tax bill issued by
48 such political subdivision for homestead properties shall contain a notice in bold print
49 that corresponds with the following statement:
50 '[Name of the political subdivision] chose to opt out of property tax relief for
51 homeowners related to HB 581 (2024). If you have concerns about that decision,
52 please call [the main telephone number for the levying or recommending authority of
53 the political subdivision].'
54 (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply for any taxable year
55 beginning after December 31, 2029."
56 SECTION 1-3.
57 Said title is further amended in Code Section 48-5-44.2, relating to base year homestead
58 exemption, by revising paragraph (4) of subsection (a) and subsections (e) and (i) as follows:

- 3 -

25 LC 50 1237S
65 benefit of such assessment pursuant to subparagraph (a)(1)(B) of Code Section 48-5-7.4
66 or subparagraph (b)(2)(B) of Code Section 48-5-7.7."
67 "(e) The exemption granted by subsection (b) or (c) of this Code section shall be claimed
68 and returned as provided in Code Section 48-5-50.1. Such exemption shall be
69 automatically renewed from year to year so long as the owner occupies the residence as a
70 homestead. After a person or a person's agent has filed the proper application or is
71 automatically granted the homestead exemption as provided in subsection (d) of this Code
72 section, it shall not be necessary for such person or such person's surviving spouse to make
73 application thereafter for any year, and the exemption shall continue to be allowed to such
74 person or such person's surviving spouse. It shall be the duty of any person granted the
75 homestead exemption under subsection (b) or (c) of this Code section to notify the tax
76 receiver or tax commissioner of the local government or governments in the event such
77 person for any reason becomes ineligible for such exemption."
78 "(i)(1) The governing authority of any county, consolidated government, municipality,
79 or school district may elect to opt out of the homestead exemption otherwise granted by
80 subsection (b) of this Code section with respect to such political subdivision through the
81 adoption of a resolution to do the same by March 1, 2025, after completing the following
82 steps:
83 (1)(A) The governing authority shall advertise its intent to do so and shall conduct at
84 least three public hearings thereon, at least one of which shall commence between the
85 hours of 6:00 P.M. and 7:00 P.M., inclusive, on a business weekday. The governing
86 authority shall place an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation serving the
87 residents of the political subdivision and post such advertisement on its website, which
88 shall read as follows:
89 'INTENT TO OPT OUT OF HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION
90 The (name of governing authority) intends to opt out of the statewide adjusted
91 base year ad valorem homestead exemption for (name of the political subdivision).
- 4 -

25 LC 50 1237S
92 All concerned citizens are invited to the public hearing on this matter to be held
93 at (place of meeting) on (date and time).
94 Times and places of additional public hearings on this matter are at (place of
95 meeting) on (date and time).'
96 Simultaneously with this notice the governing authority shall provide a press release to
97 the local media.; and
98 (2)(B) The advertisement required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (1) of this
99 subsection shall appear at least one week prior to each hearing, be prominently
100 displayed, be not less than 30 square inches, and not be placed in that section of the
101 newspaper where legal notices appear and shall be posted on the appropriate website
102 at least one week prior to each hearing. In addition to the advertisement specified under
103 this paragraph, the levying or recommending authority may include in the notice
104 reasons or explanations for its intention to opt out of the homestead exemption.
105 (3)(2) No resolution election to opt out of the homestead exemption pursuant to this
106 Code section shall become effective with respect to a political subdivision unless the
107 procedures and hearings required by paragraph (1) of this subsection are completed and
108 a copy of such resolution is filed with the Secretary of State by March 1, 2025.
109 (3) For an election to opt out of the homestead exemption pursuant to this subsection to
110 remain effective for tax years 2027 and after with respect to a political subdivision that
111 does not have in effect a base year value homestead exemption or an adjusted base year
112 value homestead exemption that is generally applicable to homestead residents, the
113 governing authority of such political subdivision shall complete the same procedures and
114 hearings required by paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that a copy of the required
115 resolution shall be filed with the Secretary of State by March 1, 2027.
116 (4) The governing authority of any county, consolidated government, municipality, or
117 school district that has elected to opt out of the homestead exemption pursuant to this
118 subsection may rescind such election at any time by adopting a resolution to do so and
- 5 -

25 LC 50 1237S
119 filing a copy of such resolution with the Secretary of State; provided, however, that such
120 resolution to rescind the election to opt out shall only be effective for:
121 (A) Tax year 2025 if a copy of the resolution is filed with the Secretary of State by
122 April 30, 2025; and
123 (B) Any other tax year from 2026 through 2029 if a copy of the resolution is filed with
124 the Secretary of State by March 1 of such year."
125 SECTION 1-4.

133 subsequent to the property becoming the primary residence of the applicant up to and
134 including the date for the closing of the books for the return of taxes for the calendar year,
135 except that, in the case of a property which is subject to a reassessment by the board of
136 tax assessors, such application and schedule may be filed in conjunction with or in lieu
137 of an appeal of the reassessment.
138 (2) The failure to file properly the application and schedule on or before the date for the
139 closing of the books for the return of taxes of a calendar year in which the taxes are due
140 shall constitute a waiver of the homestead exemption on the part of the applicant failing
141 to make the application for such exemption for that year."

266 authorized tax shall not be imposed."

25 LC 50 1237S
267 SECTION 3-2.

270 "48-8-109.31.
271 (a) Subject to the requirement of approval by local referendum and the other requirements
272 of this article, to impose there may be imposed within any given special district a special
273 sales and use tax for a limited period of time for the limited purpose of property tax relief.
274 (b) Except as to rate, a tax imposed under this part shall correspond to the tax imposed by

307 subsection (d) of this Code section.
308 (2) If the combined total of the populations of all such absent municipalities is less than
309 one-half of the aggregate population of all municipalities located within the special
310 district that levy an ad valorem tax on property, the political subdivisions governing
311 authorities entering into the such intergovernmental agreement shall, on in behalf of such
312 absent municipalities, specify a percentage of that portion of the remaining proceeds
