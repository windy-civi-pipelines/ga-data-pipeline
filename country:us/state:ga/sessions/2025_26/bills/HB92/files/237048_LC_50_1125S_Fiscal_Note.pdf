SUBJECT: Fiscal Note
House Bill 92 (LC 50 1125S)
Dear Chairman Hufstetler:
The bill would make a number of changes to the collection of property taxes by local governments. It
applies the definition of estimated roll-back rate to each individual taxing authority, modifies
requirements for ad valorem property tax bill forms and the annual notice of assessment, limits the
acreage for a base-year floating homestead exemption, and ensures that homeowners or a surviving
spouse need not file an exemption each year. The bill would also extend the period for local
governments and school districts to opt-out of a floating homestead exemption that would limit annual
taxable increases from March 1, 2025 to March 31, 2025. Further, it would modify the period for filing a
homestead exemption in some cases. Finally, the bill would require levying authorities to annually
calculate and certify their estimated roll-back rates by March 31 each year.
The bill would have no fiscal impact on the state. No state revenue is generated from ad valorem taxes
on homesteads.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin Richard Dunn, Director
State Auditor Office of Planning and Budget
