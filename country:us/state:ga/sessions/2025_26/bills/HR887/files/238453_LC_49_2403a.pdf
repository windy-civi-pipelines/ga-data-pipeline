House Resolution 887
By: Representatives Blackmon of the 146th and Erwin of the 32nd
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the House Study Committee on Reducing and Prioritizing Mandates for Public
2 School Administration; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, providing for public education is a primary responsibility of the State of
4 Georgia, as enshrined in the Constitution; and
5 WHEREAS, local school systems are established and maintained and under the management
6 and control of local boards of education; and
7 WHEREAS, providing for the education of Georgia's public school students is a
8 responsibility shared by state and local governing authorities; and
9 WHEREAS, the effective administration of public elementary and secondary schools in this
10 state requires local boards of education, local school system administrators, and public school
11 administrators to address many and varied state and federal statutory and regulatory
12 mandates; and
13 WHEREAS, the addition of new legal mandates each year to existing mandates, some of
14 which have become outmoded or are practically unenforceable, can have the unintended

15 effect of dividing the attention of local boards of education, local school system
16 administrators, and public school administrators, with increasing attention paid to
17 administrative matters at the expense of decreasing attention paid to supporting and
18 improving student learning; and
19 WHEREAS, it is critical that state and local resources and efforts should be primarily
20 focused on supporting and improving student learning rather than complying with legal
21 mandates, especially such mandates that have become outmoded, are practically
22 unenforceable, or are no longer the priority of state and local governing authorities; and
23 WHEREAS, a review of existing mandates relating to public school administration is needed
24 for legislators, education leaders, and community stakeholders to examine and evaluate best
25 practices for reducing and prioritizing mandates for public school administrators, and to
26 recommend legislative and policy initiatives to that end.
