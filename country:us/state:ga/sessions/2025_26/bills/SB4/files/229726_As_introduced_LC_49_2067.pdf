17 (a) The fundamental role of a local board of education shall be to establish policy for the
18 local school system with the focus on student achievement. The fundamental role of a
19 local school superintendent shall be to implement the policy established by the local board.
20 It shall not be the role of the local board of education or individual members of such board
21 to micromanage the superintendent in executing his or her duties, but it shall be the duty
22 of the local board to hold the local school superintendent accountable in the performance
23 of his or her duties; provided, however, that requesting and reviewing financial data and
24 documents shall not constitute micromanaging. No individual member of a local board
25 shall discuss any individual personnel matter with the local school superintendent or other

27 Section 20-2-989.7, Code Section 20-2-989.8, Code Section 20-2-1160, Code

30 shall not be prohibited. Local board of education members should work together with the
31 entire local board of education and shall not have authority as independent elected officials
32 but shall only be authorized to take official action as members of the board as a whole.
33 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter, limit, expand, or enlarge any powers,
34 duties, or responsibilities of local boards of education, local board members, or local school
35 superintendents.
36 (b) Except as may be allowed by law, no local board of education shall delegate or attempt

48 superintendents. Such model code of ethics shall also provide for individuals who are
