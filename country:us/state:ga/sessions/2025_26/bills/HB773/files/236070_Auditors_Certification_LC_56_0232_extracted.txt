State Representative

SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
Dear Representative Bell:
This bill would amend provisions relating to membership in the Teachers Retirement System of
Georgia. Specifically, this bill would authorize certain persons who would otherwise be members of
the Public School Employees Retirement System to make an irrevocable election to become members
of the Teachers Retirement System. This option would only be available to persons who work at least
half time. Once such election is made, the members would be covered under the same provisions and
contribution requirements as other members of the Teachers Retirement System.
Under the provisions of this bill, persons who make this election may not receive creditable service in
the Teachers Retirement System for time worked as a member of the Public School Employees
Retirement System. Vested persons who transfer into the Teachers Retirement System may elect to
keep their accumulated contributions with the Public School Employees Retirement System and
receive their earned pension upon reaching normal retirement age. Vested members who elect to
withdraw their accumulated contributions would forfeit any right to a future benefit. Nonvested
members who transfer into the Teachers Retirement System would be required to withdraw their
accumulated contributions.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems
Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
