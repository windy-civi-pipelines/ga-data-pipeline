12 revising Code Section 33-9-4, relating to standards applicable to making and use of rates, as

14 "33-9-4.
15 (a) As used in this Code section, the term:
H. B. 902

25 LC 52 0851
16 (1) 'Excessive' means the rate is likely to produce a long-term profit that is unreasonably
17 high in relation to the insurance coverage provided. Any rate increase of 10 percent or
18 more within any 12 month period and any filing for a rate increase two or more times
19 within any 24 month period shall be presumed to be excessive.
20 (2) 'Inadequate' means the rate is insufficient to sustain projected losses and expenses to
21 which the rate applies and continued use of the rate endangers the solvency of the insurer
22 or has the effect of substantially lessening competition or creating a monopoly in a
23 market.
24 (3) 'Unfairly discriminatory' means the rate is not based on sound actuarial principles,
25 does not bear a reasonable relationship to the expected loss and expense experience
26 among risks, or is based wholly or partly on the race, creed, color, ethnicity, or national
27 origin of the applicant, policyholder, or insured.
28 (b) The following standards shall apply to the making and use of rates pertaining to all
29 classes of insurance to which this chapter is applicable:
30 (1) Rates shall not be excessive, or inadequate, or as defined in this Code section, nor
31 shall they be unfairly discriminatory;
32 (2) No rate shall be held to be excessive unless such rate is unreasonably high for the
33 insurance provided and a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the area with
34 respect to the classification to which such rate is applicable; provided, however, with
35 respect to rate filings involving an increase in rates, no rate for personal private passenger
36 motor vehicle insurance shall be held to be excessive unless such rate is unreasonably
37 high for the insurance provided and a reasonable degree of competition does not exist;
38 (3) No rate shall be held inadequate unless it is unreasonably low for the insurance
39 provided and continued use of it would endanger solvency of the insurer, or unless the
40 use of such rate by the insurer using such rate has, or will, if continued, tend to destroy
41 competition or create a monopoly;

25 LC 52 0851
42 (4)(2) Consideration shall be given to the extent applicable to past and prospective loss
43 experience within and outside this state, to conflagration and catastrophe hazards, to a
44 reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, to past and prospective
45 expenses both country wide and those specially applicable to this state, to the insurer's
46 average yield from investment income, and to all other factors, including judgment
47 factors, deemed relevant within and outside this state; and, in the case of fire insurance
48 rates, consideration may be given to the experience of the fire insurance business during
49 the most recent five-year period;
50 (5)(3) Consideration may also be given, in the making and use of rates, to dividends,
51 savings, or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their
52 policyholders, members, or subscribers;
53 (6)(4) The systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or
54 group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect
55 the operating methods of any such insurer or group with respect to any kind of insurance
56 or with respect to any subdivision or combination thereof;
57 (7)(5) Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and
58 minimum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual
59 risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations
60 in hazards or expense provisions, or both. Such standards may measure any difference
61 among risks that have a probable effect upon losses or expenses. Classifications or
62 modifications of classifications of risks may be established based upon size, expense,
63 management, individual experience, location or dispersion of hazard, or any other
64 reasonable considerations. Such classifications and modifications shall apply to all risks
65 under the same or substantially the same circumstances or conditions; provided, however,
66 the Commissioner shall establish the maximum amount of any such modification;
67 (8)(6) Nothing contained in this Code section or elsewhere in this chapter shall be
68 construed to repeal or modify Chapter 6 of this title, relating to unfair trade practices, and
H. B. 902
- 3 -

25 LC 52 0851
69 any rate, rating classification, rating plan or schedule, or variation thereof established in
70 violation of Chapter 6 of this title shall, in addition to the consequences stated in Chapter
71 6 of this title or elsewhere, be deemed violative of to violate this Code section;
72 (9)(7) No insurer shall base any standard or rating plan on vehicle insurance, in whole
73 or in part, directly or indirectly, upon race, creed, or ethnic extraction; and
74 (10)(8) No insurer shall base any standard or rating plan on vehicle insurance, in whole
75 or in part, directly or indirectly, upon any physical disability of an insured unless the
76 disability directly impairs the ability of the insured to drive a motor vehicle."
77 SECTION 2.
78 Said title is further amended in said chapter by revising subsection (e) of Code
79 Section 33-9-21, relating to maintenance and filing rates, rating plans, rating systems, or
80 underwriting rules and examination of claim reserve practices by the Commissioner, as
81 follows:
82 "(e)(1) When a rate filing of an insurer required under subsection (d) of this Code section
83 results in any overall rate increase of 10 percent or more within any 12 month period or
84 when an insurer files for a rate increase more than two times within any 24 month period,
85 the Commissioner shall order an a financial and market conduct examination of that
86 insurer to determine the accuracy of the claim reserves, the applicability of the claim
87 reserve practices for the loss data used in support of such filing, and any other component
88 of the rate filing, such insurer's compliance with federal and state laws and regulations,
89 and such insurer's marketing practices, claims handling, complaint handling, and
90 policyholder service; provided, however, that in the event the overall increase is less than
91 25 percent within any 12 month period and the Commissioner affirmatively determines
92 that he or she has sufficient information to evaluate such rate increase and that the cost
93 thereof would not be justified, he or she may waive all or part of such examination. In
94 all other rate filings required under subsection (d) of this Code section, the Commissioner
H. B. 902
- 4 -

25 LC 52 0851
95 may order an a financial and market conduct examination of that insurer as provided in
96 this subsection. Such examination shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions
97 of Chapter 2 of this title. Upon notification by the Commissioner of his or her intent to
98 conduct such examination, the insurer shall be prohibited from placing the rates so filed
99 in effect until such examination has been reviewed and certified by the Commissioner as
100 being complete. Such examination, if conducted by the Commissioner, shall be reviewed
101 and certified within 90 45 days of the date such rate, rating plan, rating system, or
102 underwriting rule is filed; provided, however, that, if the Commissioner makes an
103 affirmative finding that the examination may not be completed within the 90 day such
104 period, he or she may extend such time for one additional 60 45 day period.
105 (2) The Commissioner shall conduct a public hearing within 30 days of the completion
106 of any examination conducted pursuant to this subsection. The Commissioner shall be
107 authorized to take depositions, subpoena witnesses, administer oaths or affirmations,
108 examine any individual under oath, and compel the production of records, books, papers,
109 and other documents, including, but not limited to, a detailed actuarial report
110 demonstrating the necessity of the proposed rate increase based on claims trends, risk
111 factors, and financial solvency; a breakdown of administrative expenses, claim costs, and
112 anticipated profit margins; a statement on how the proposed rate increase shall affect
113 policyholders, including families, small businesses, and commercial enterprises in this
114 state; historical past rate changes and corresponding justifications for the preceding five
115 years; and any other documents deemed necessary. Any examination hearing required
116 under this Code section subsection shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 2 of
117 this title."

135 be based on data in existence on or after January 1, 2019, and shall be updated annually and
