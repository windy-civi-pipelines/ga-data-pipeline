SUBJECT: State Auditor's Certification
House Bill (LC 56 0421)
Dear Representative Franklin:
This bill would amend provisions relating to retirement benefits payable to members of the Georgia
Legislative Retirement System. In 2022, the General Assembly passed House Bill 824 which
increased retirement benefits for persons who were members of the Georgia Legislative Retirement
System on January 1, 2022, and for any person who became a member after such date. The benefits
payable to persons who had retired prior to such date and to former vested members would not be
affected by this legislation.
This bill would remove this restriction and allow for all retired and vested former members to receive
the increased benefits. If this legislation is enacted, the benefits for retired and former vested
members would be increased to $50/month for each year of creditable service and an additional
$200/month for each year of such member's presiding creditable service.
This is to certify that this bill is a fiscal retirement bill as defined in the Public Retirement Systems
Standards Law.
Respectfully,
Greg S. Griffin
State Auditor
