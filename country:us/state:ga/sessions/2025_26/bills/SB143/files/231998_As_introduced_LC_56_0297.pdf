51 whichever is later.

74 benefit which shall be payable during the joint lifetime of both the member and the
75 member's spouse and which shall continue after the death of the member during the
76 lifetime of the spouse in the amount chosen by the member, which amount shall be 100

117 member under subsection (b) or (c) of this Code section based upon the interest rate and
118 mortality basis approved from time to time by the board, the age of the member, and, if
