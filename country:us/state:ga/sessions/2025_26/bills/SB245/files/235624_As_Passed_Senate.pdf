25 LC 57 0150
16 "(c)(1) Upon the filing of an original action or upon intervention in an existing
17 proceeding under subsection (b) of this Code section, the court may grant any family
18 member of the child reasonable visitation rights if the court finds by clear and convincing
19 evidence that the health or welfare of the child would be harmed unless such visitation
20 is granted and if the best interests of the child would be served by such visitation. The
21 mere absence of an opportunity for a child to develop a relationship with a family
22 member shall not be considered as harming the health or welfare of the child when there
23 is no substantial preexisting relationship between the child and such family member. In
24 considering whether the health or welfare of the child would be harmed without such
25 visitation, the court shall consider and may find that harm to the child is reasonably likely
26 to result when, prior to the original action or intervention:
27 (A) The minor child resided with the family member for six months or more;
28 (B) The family member provided financial support for the basic needs of the child for
29 at least one year;
30 (C) There was an established pattern of regular visitation with the child by the family
31 member or child care provided by the family member with for the child; or
32 (D) Any other circumstance exists indicating that emotional or physical harm would
33 be reasonably likely to result if such visitation is not granted.
34 The court shall make specific written findings of fact in support of its rulings.
35 (2) An original action requesting visitation rights shall not be filed by any grandparent
36 more than once during any two-year period and shall not be filed during any year in
37 which another custody action has been filed concerning the child. After visitation rights
38 have been granted to any grandparent, such grandparent, or the legal custodian, guardian
39 of the person, or parent of the child, may petition the court for revocation or amendment
40 of such visitation rights, for good cause shown, which the court, in its discretion, may
41 grant or deny; but provided, however, that such a petition shall not be filed more than
42 once in during any two-year period.

43 (3) While a parent's decision regarding family member visitation shall be given
44 deference by the court, the parent's decision shall not be conclusive when failure to
45 provide family member contact would result in emotional harm to the child. A court may
46 presume that a child who is denied any contact with his or her family member or who is
47 not provided some minimal opportunity for contact with his or her family member when
48 there is a preexisting relationship between the child and such family member may suffer
49 emotional injury that is harmful to such child's health. Such presumption shall be a
50 rebuttable presumption.
51 (4) In no case shall the granting of visitation rights to a family member interfere with a
52 child's school or regularly scheduled extracurricular activities.
53 (5) Visitation time awarded to a family member shall not be less than 24 hours in any
54 one-month period; provided, however, that when more than one individual seeks
55 visitation under this Code section, the court shall determine the amount of time to award
56 to each petitioner which shall not be less than 24 hours in any one-month period in the
57 aggregate.
58 (d)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this Code section, if
59 one of the parents of a minor child dies, is incapacitated, or is incarcerated, the court may
60 award the parent of the deceased, incapacitated, or incarcerated parent of such minor
61 child reasonable visitation to such child during his or her minority if the court finds by
62 clear and convincing evidence that the health or welfare of the child would be harmed
63 unless such visitation is granted and if the best interests of the child would be served by
64 such visitation. After such visitation rights have been granted to any parent of the
65 deceased, incapacitated, or incarcerated parent of the minor child, such parent may
66 petition the court for revocation or amendment of such visitation rights for good cause
67 shown, which the court, in its discretion, may grant or deny; provided, however, that such
68 a petition shall not be filed more than once during any two-year period. The mere
69 absence of an opportunity for a child to develop a relationship with a grandparent shall
S. B. 245

25 LC 57 0150
70 not be considered as harming the health or welfare of the child when there is no
71 substantial preexisting relationship between the child and such grandparent. The
72 custodial parent's judgment as to the best interests of the child regarding visitation shall
73 be given deference by the court but shall not be conclusive. In considering whether the
74 health or welfare of the child would be harmed without such visitation, the court shall
75 consider and may find that harm to the child is reasonably likely to result when, prior to
76 the death, incapacitation, or incarceration of the child's parent:
77 (A) The minor child resided with the grandparent for six months or more;
78 (B) The grandparent provided financial support for the basic needs of the child for at
79 least one year;
80 (C) There was an established pattern of regular visitation or child care by the
81 grandparent with the child; or
82 (D) Any other circumstance exists indicating that emotional or physical harm would
83 be reasonably likely to result if such visitation is not granted.
84 The court shall make specific written findings of fact in support of its rulings.
85 (2) While a custodial parent's decision regarding grandparent visitation shall be given
86 deference by the court, the parent's decision shall not be conclusive when failure to
87 provide grandparent contact would result in emotional harm to the child. A court may
88 presume that a child who is denied any contact with his or her grandparent or who is not
89 provided some minimal opportunity for contact with his or her grandparent when there
90 is a preexisting relationship between the child and such grandparent may suffer emotional
91 injury that is harmful to such child's health. Such presumption shall be a rebuttable
92 presumption."
93 SECTION 2.
94 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
