23 purposes of this chapter. Any independent motor vehicle leasing agency which sells
24 or offers for sale used motor vehicles shall be deemed to be a used motor vehicle dealer
25 or a used car dealer for the purposes of this chapter. Any motor vehicle auction
26 company selling or offering for sale used motor vehicles to independent motor vehicle
27 dealers or to individual consumers shall be deemed to be a used motor vehicle dealer
28 or used car dealer for the purposes of this chapter except as otherwise provided in
29 division (x) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. Without limiting any of the
30 foregoing, the sale of five or more used motor vehicles in any one calendar year shall
31 be prima-facie evidence that a person is engaged in the business of selling used motor
32 vehicles. A pawnbroker who disposes of all repossessed motor vehicles by selling or
33 exchanging his or her interest in such motor vehicles only to licensees under this
34 chapter shall not be considered a used motor vehicle dealer under this chapter as long
35 as such pawnbroker does not otherwise engage in activities which would bring him or
36 her under the licensing requirements of this chapter."
37 "(v) Financial institutions when the financial institution sells its repossessed or leased
38 motor vehicles. Finance companies, for purposes of this chapter, shall not include a
