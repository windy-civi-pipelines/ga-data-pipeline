30 be subject to ejection from such premises.

32 writing, before any officer authorized to administer an oath setting forth that such
33 innkeeper, its agent, or its attorney in fact claims, in good faith, that the occupancy of a
34 guest has expired or otherwise terminated or the person does not have a valid contract and
35 refuses to vacate the premises, it shall be the duty of the sheriff, sheriff deputy, constable,
36 marshal, or other individual certified by the Georgia Peace Officer Standards and
37 Training Council of the county where the inn is located, upon receiving such affidavit,
38 to eject such person within five days of receiving such affidavit.
