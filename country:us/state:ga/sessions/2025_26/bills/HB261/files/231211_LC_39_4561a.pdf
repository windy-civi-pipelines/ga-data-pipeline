42 (B)(i) As used in this paragraph, the term 'alternative fueled vehicle' shall
43 have the same meaning as in division (l)(7)(B)(ii) of Code Section 40-2-86.1;

47 (ii) The fees in this paragraph shall be in addition to any other fee imposed
48 on the vehicle by this Code section.
49 (iii) The fees in this paragraph shall be automatically adjusted on an annual

51 from the previous year as measured by using the average of combined miles
52 per gallon published in the United States Department of Energy Fuel

54 decrease shall be added or subtracted from the fee. This preliminary fee
55 adjustment shall then be multiplied by the increase or decrease in the
