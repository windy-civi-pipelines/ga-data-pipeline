255 SECTION 12.
256 Revenue bonds; conditions precedent to issuance.
257 The authority shall adopt a resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds. In the
258 resolution, the authority shall determine that the project financed with the proceeds of such
259 revenue bonds is self-liquidating. Revenue bonds may be issued without any other
260 proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings,
261 conditions, and things which are specified or required by this Act. Any resolution providing
262 for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective
263 immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution
264 may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the authority by a majority of its members
265 present and voting.
266 SECTION 13.
267 Credit not pledged.
268 Revenue bonds of the authority shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of any member
269 entity, any other county, municipality, local authority, or political subdivision in the region
270 that is not a member entity, or the State of Georgia, nor a pledge of the faith and credit of this
271 state or such county or municipality, but such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the
272 fund hereinafter provided for. The issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly,
273 indirectly, or contingently obligate this state or such county or municipality to levy or pledge
274 any form of taxation whatsoever for payment of such revenue bonds or to make any
275 appropriation for their payment, and all such revenue bonds shall contain recitals on their
276 face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. Notwithstanding the
277 foregoing provisions, this Act shall not affect the ability of the authority and any political
278 subdivision to enter into an intergovernmental contract pursuant to which the political
S. B. 368
- 12 -
25 LC 47 3655
279 subdivision agrees to pay amounts sufficient to pay operating charges and other costs of the
280 authority or any project including, without limitation, the principal of and interest on revenue
281 bonds in consideration for services or facilities of the authority.
282 SECTION 14.
283 Trust indenture as security.
284 In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust
285 indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust
286 company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without this state. Either
287 the resolution providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds or such trust indenture may
288 contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the
289 bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including
290 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition and
291 construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project,
292 and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all money.
293 SECTION 15.
294 Trust indenture as security; remedies of bondholders.
295 Any holder of revenue bonds and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the
296 extent that the rights given herein may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance
297 of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action,
298 mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights it may have under
299 the laws of the state, including specifically, but without limitation, the Revenue Bond Law,
300 or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel
301 performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be

302 performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and
303 collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the facilities and
304 services furnished.
305 SECTION 16.
306 Trust indenture as security; validation.
307 Revenue bonds and the security therefor shall be issued, confirmed, and validated in
308 accordance with the provisions of the Revenue Bond Law. The petition for validation shall
309 also make a member entity or member entities party defendant to such action if such political
310 subdivision or subdivisions have contracted with the authority for services or facilities
311 relating to the project for which revenue bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated,
312 and such defendant shall be required to show cause, if any exists, as to why such contract or
313 contracts shall not be adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any
314 such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation
315 shall be final and conclusive with respect to such revenue bonds and the security for the
316 payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority and all other defendants.
317 SECTION 17.
318 To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid.
319 In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the
320 authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue bonds to
321 any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee
322 of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such
323 regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.

325 Sinking fund.
326 The money received pursuant to an intergovernmental contract and the revenues, fees, tolls,
327 fines, charges, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of
328 whether or not such revenues, fees, tolls, fines, charges, and earnings were produced by a
329 particular project for which revenue bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and
330 allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and
331 interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the
332 revenue bonds or the trust indenture may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever
333 source received may be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution
334 or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged
335 with the payment of:
336 (1) The interest upon such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due;
337 (2) The principal or purchase price of such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due;
338 (3) Any premium upon such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due;
339 (4) The purchase of such revenue bonds in the open market; and
340 (5) The necessary charges of the paying agent for paying principal and interest.
341 The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be
342 provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust
343 indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture,
344 such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds
345 without distinction or priority of one over another.

349 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A., the "Revenue Bond Law," or any suit or action against the
350 authority shall be brought in any superior court with jurisdiction over a member entity, and
351 any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under this Act shall likewise be
352 brought in said court, which shall have jurisdiction of such actions.
353 SECTION 20.
354 Interest of bondholders protected.
355 While any of the revenue bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers,
356 duties, or existence of such authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be
357 diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the
358 holders of such revenue bonds; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority shall
359 be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the
360 interests and rights of the holders of such revenue bonds, nor shall the state itself so compete
361 with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the
362 holders of any such revenue bonds, and, upon the issuance of such revenue bonds under the
363 provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such revenue bonds.

255 SECTION 12.
256 Revenue bonds; conditions precedent to issuance.
257 The authority shall adopt a resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds. In the
258 resolution, the authority shall determine that the project financed with the proceeds of such
259 revenue bonds is self-liquidating. Revenue bonds may be issued without any other
260 proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings,
261 conditions, and things which are specified or required by this Act. Any resolution providing
262 for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective
263 immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution
264 may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the authority by a majority of its members
265 present and voting.
266 SECTION 13.
267 Credit not pledged.
268 Revenue bonds of the authority shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of any member
269 entity, any other county, municipality, local authority, or political subdivision in the region
270 that is not a member entity, or the State of Georgia, nor a pledge of the faith and credit of this
271 state or such county or municipality, but such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the
272 fund hereinafter provided for. The issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly,
273 indirectly, or contingently obligate this state or such county or municipality to levy or pledge
274 any form of taxation whatsoever for payment of such revenue bonds or to make any
275 appropriation for their payment, and all such revenue bonds shall contain recitals on their
276 face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. Notwithstanding the
277 foregoing provisions, this Act shall not affect the ability of the authority and any political
278 subdivision to enter into an intergovernmental contract pursuant to which the political
S. B. 368
- 12 -

25 LC 47 3655
279 subdivision agrees to pay amounts sufficient to pay operating charges and other costs of the
280 authority or any project including, without limitation, the principal of and interest on revenue
281 bonds in consideration for services or facilities of the authority.
282 SECTION 14.
283 Trust indenture as security.
284 In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust
285 indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust
286 company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without this state. Either
287 the resolution providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds or such trust indenture may
288 contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the
289 bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including
290 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition and
291 construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project,
292 and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all money.
293 SECTION 15.
294 Trust indenture as security; remedies of bondholders.
295 Any holder of revenue bonds and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the
296 extent that the rights given herein may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance
297 of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action,

325 Sinking fund.
326 The money received pursuant to an intergovernmental contract and the revenues, fees, tolls,
327 fines, charges, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of
328 whether or not such revenues, fees, tolls, fines, charges, and earnings were produced by a
329 particular project for which revenue bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and
330 allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and
331 interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the
332 revenue bonds or the trust indenture may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever
333 source received may be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution
334 or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged
335 with the payment of:
336 (1) The interest upon such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due;
337 (2) The principal or purchase price of such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due;
338 (3) Any premium upon such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due;
339 (4) The purchase of such revenue bonds in the open market; and
340 (5) The necessary charges of the paying agent for paying principal and interest.
341 The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be
342 provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust
343 indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture,
344 such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds
345 without distinction or priority of one over another.

358 holders of such revenue bonds; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority shall
359 be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the
360 interests and rights of the holders of such revenue bonds, nor shall the state itself so compete
361 with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the
362 holders of any such revenue bonds, and, upon the issuance of such revenue bonds under the
363 provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such revenue bonds.
