Honorable Marty Harbin
Chairman, Senate Government Oversight

SUBJECT: Fiscal Note
Senate Bill 46 (LC 60 0040)
Dear Chairman Harbin:
The bill (known as the Government Serves the People Act) would create the position of Government
Service Delivery Lead within the Georgia Technology Authority (GTA). The Government Service
Delivery Lead would facilitate and coordinate government-wide efforts to improve service delivery
by state agencies, particularly those operating high impact service delivery programs as defined by
the bill. The bill would also require agency heads (with the exception of the Board of Regents and
University System of Georgia institutions) to appoint a lead agency service delivery official whose
duties would include coordinating and executing efforts to improve service delivery and service
delivery channels (e.g., in-person, mail, telephone, contact center), submitting 12-month plans for
improving service delivery, and assisting with incorporating service delivery requirements in agency
plans. The bill requires GTA to submit an annual report on agency efforts to improve service
delivery beginning in 2026.
Information provided by GTA indicates that the bill would cost an estimated $388,000 to
implement. The additional funding would cover the salary and benefits for one position that would
serve as the Government Service Delivery Lead ($238,000) and the software needed to implement
data collection and reporting responsibilities under the bill ($150,000). According to GTA, the
software cost is a conservative estimate; additional information from potential vendors would be
necessary to gauge the accuracy of the estimate.
Information provided by five state agencies with customer service functions (Department of Driver
Services, Department of Human Services, Department of Natural Resources, Department of
Revenue, Secretary of State) suggests that agencies vary in their ability to implement the bill’s
requirements within existing resources. Of the five state agencies, two indicated the bill’s provisions
could be implemented at no additional cost to the state. The remaining three agencies estimate they
would need between $92,000 and $160,000 to cover salary and benefits of one position to perform
the duties of the lead agency service delivery official. This survey focused on a sample of agencies
that have significant customer interaction. As the bill would apply to all state agencies, excluding the
Board of Regents and USG institutions, there may be additional costs for agencies not surveyed that
have a need for dedicated personnel to meet the requirements of the lead agency service delivery
official.
If new or enhanced technology becomes necessary to implement customer service improvements,
some agencies may need additional funding, though these costs cannot be estimated at this time.

The bill requires GTA to encourage the adoption of commercial products to measure service delivery
and customer satisfaction and the cost of those services may vary by agency based on their scope
and mission. To the extent that agencies have existing call centers that already track many
performance metrics related to customer service, improvements such as end-of-call surveys could
be added at relatively low cost.
Respectfully,
