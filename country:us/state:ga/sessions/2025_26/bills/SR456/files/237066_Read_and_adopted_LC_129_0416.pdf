13 WHEREAS, high-quality early childhood education depends on high-quality early childhood
14 educators who ensure that children, supported by families, have the early experiences they
15 need for a strong foundation; and
16 WHEREAS, tuition from fee-paying parents and subsidy rates for families with low incomes
17 are typically insufficient to afford highly-qualified, consistent early childhood educators and
18 pay for the low child-to-educator ratios that ensure the health and safety of children; and
19 WHEREAS, young children need early childhood educators who are incentivized and
20 supported to provide high-quality care to those with high and special needs; and
21 WHEREAS, working families need sufficient high-quality childcare spaces beginning at
22 birth to be available in the community; and
23 WHEREAS, early childhood educators need the ability to earn a family-sustaining wage that
24 is commensurate with the required education and skills they bring to the complex and
25 valuable work they do; and
26 WHEREAS, it is urged by members of our community to support efforts that increase
27 children's and families access to high-quality early childhood education and commit to
28 investments that stabilize, sustain, and support childcare and early learning so this essential
29 workforce can continue to support children, families, and our economy through the pandemic
30 crisis, recovery, and beyond.
31 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
32 hereby recognize the complex, valuable, essential, and demanding work of the early
33 childhood educators and recognize, April 5-11 as The Week of the Young Child.
