18 which the presence of the personnel requesting absence is essential for effective school
19 operation. No grant of approval for an absence permitted under this Code section shall be

22 personnel to disclose the specific purpose for which such an absence is sought; provided,
23 however, that personnel may be requested to state whether the absence is sought under the
24 category of 'personal' or 'professional' absence."
25 SECTION 2.
26 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
