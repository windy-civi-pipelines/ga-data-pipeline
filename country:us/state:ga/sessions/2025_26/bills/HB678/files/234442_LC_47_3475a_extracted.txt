25 LC 47 3475
16 "36-80-32.
17 (a) As used in this Code section, the term 'authority' means any:
18 (1) Instrumentality of the state or a county, municipality, or a joint undertaking thereof
19 that has less than state-wide jurisdiction and was created to fulfill a specialized public
20 purpose; or
21 (2) Other legally created organization that has authority to issue debt for a public purpose
22 independent of the state, a county, or municipality with less than state-wide jurisdiction,
23 regardless of whether such instrumentality or organization was created by a local
24 constitutional amendment, general law, or local law.
25 (b) An authority shall be deemed to be providing a public service and exercising public
26 duties and, notwithstanding any provisions of an authority's enabling legislation to the
27 contrary, shall have the same sovereign immunity and exemption from liability for torts
28 and negligence as a county, and the officers, agents, and employees of such authority when
29 in the performance of the work of the authority shall have the same immunity and
30 exemption from liability for torts and negligence as the officers, agents, and employees of
31 a county when in the performance of their public duties or work of the county.
32 (c) It is the specific intent of the General Assembly that tort claims against authorities shall
33 be subject to the limitations on liability of the state found in Article 2 of Chapter 21 of

35 against an authority, no claimant shall recover a sum exceeding $1 million from any single
36 authority because of a loss arising from a single occurrence; and any single authority's

38 on liability shall not be disclosed or suggested to the jury during the trial of any action
39 brought against an authority.
40 (d) No award for damages against an authority shall include punitive or exemplary
41 damages or interest prior to judgment.

45 amount per occurrence as set forth in this Code section.
46 (f) Trial of tort claims against an authority shall be conducted by a judge with a jury;
47 provided, however, that the parties may agree that the same be tried by a judge without a
48 jury.
49 (g) The provisions of this Code section shall only apply to acts or omissions occurring on
50 or after July 1, 2025.
51 (h) This Code section shall not be construed as a waiver of immunity as required by

53 waiver must be pled and proven by the claimant as provided by law."
