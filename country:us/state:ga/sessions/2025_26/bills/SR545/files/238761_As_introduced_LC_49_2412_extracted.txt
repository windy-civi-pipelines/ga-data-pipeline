Section 1:
25 LC 49 2412
Senate Resolution 545
Jackson of the 41st and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Creating the Senate Paid Student Teaching Study Committee; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, student teaching in Georgia currently requires aspiring educators to work more
3 than 40 hours per week in public school classrooms without pay, while simultaneously
4 paying tuition and covering living expenses, creating significant financial hardship and
5 feelings of burnout; and
6 WHEREAS, this uncompensated labor creates a barrier for students from low and middle
7 income backgrounds, limiting access to the teaching profession and exacerbating the shortage
8 of new educators in Georgia's education workforce; and
9 WHEREAS, the growing teacher shortage in Georgia, compounded by high attrition rates
10 and decreased enrollment in traditional educator preparation programs, requires urgent and
11 sustainable policy solutions, including compensation during student teaching to support
12 recruitment and retention; and
13 WHEREAS, other states have launched successful paid student teaching initiatives, and
14 Georgia currently has the fiscal capacity to explore this investment with unallocated surplus
15 funds available in the state budget; and
