16 "Part 6
17 46-3-69.5.
18 (a) It is the intent of the legislature to recognize the economic, environmental, and fuel
19 diversity benefits of renewable energy resources; to encourage further development of
20 these resources; and to encourage the establishment of a market for renewable energy in
21 Georgia using this state's renewable energy resources. These efforts can reduce the
22 consumption of fossil fuels for the generation of electricity and reduce this state's
23 dependence on finite, nonrenewable resources. Accordingly, the General Assembly finds
24 and declares that goals should be established for electric service providers to guide them
25 in incorporating renewable resources into their resource portfolios.
26 (b) The purpose of this part is to lessen Georgia's dependence on fossil fuels and the
27 exposure of Georgia's consumers to volatile and rising prices for coal and natural gas by
28 encouraging the greater use of renewable energy by establishing goals for electric service
29 providers in implementing portfolio standards for renewable energy.
