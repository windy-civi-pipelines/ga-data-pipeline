270 of this Act.
271 (c) Issuance by an authority of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for
272 one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other
273 obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects, but the
274 proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be issued shall
275 recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed,
276 security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds,
277 notes, or other obligations unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is
278 expressly reserved to the authority to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations
279 on a parity with such prior issue.
280 (d) The authority shall have the power and is authorized, whenever bonds of the authority
281 shall have been validated as provided in this Act, to issue from time to time its notes in
282 anticipation of such bonds as validated and to renew from time to time any such notes by
283 the issuance of new notes, whether the notes to be renewed have or have not matured. The
284 authority may issue such bond anticipation notes only to provide funds which would
285 otherwise be provided by the issuance of the bonds as validated. Such notes may be
286 authorized, sold, executed, and delivered in the same manner as bonds. As with its bonds,
S. B. 151
- 12 -

25 LC 47 3121
287 the authority may sell such notes at public or private sale. Any resolution or resolutions
288 authorizing notes of the authority or any issue thereof may contain any provisions which
289 the authority is authorized to include in any resolution or resolutions authorizing bonds of
290 the authority or any issue thereof, and the authority may include in any notes any terms,
291 covenants, or conditions which the authority is authorized to include in any bonds.
292 Validation of such bonds shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of such notes, but
293 it shall not be required that such notes be judicially validated. Bond anticipation notes shall
294 not be issued in an amount exceeding the par value of the bonds in anticipation of which
295 they are to be issued.
296 (e) All bonds issued by the authority under this Act shall be issued and validated under and
297 in accordance with the Revenue Bond Law, as heretofore and hereafter amended, except
298 as provided in this Act, provided that notes and other obligations of the authority may, but
299 shall not be required to, be so validated.
300 (f) Bonds issued by an authority may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered or
301 both, and may be subject to exchangeability and transferability provisions as the bond
302 resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any indenture or trust agreement may
303 provide.
304 (g) Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the superior
305 court of the judicial circuit in which the issuing authority is located may be made on the
306 certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution stating the date
307 on which such bonds were validated, and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact
308 of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.
309 (h) In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which bonds to be issued by an
310 authority are to bear, the notice to the district attorney or Attorney General; the notice to
311 the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing; and the petition and
312 complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued shall bear interest at a rate
313 not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate
S. B. 151
- 13 -

25 LC 47 3121
314 or otherwise change from time to time) specified in such notices and petition and complaint
315 or that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity
316 dates, that none of such rates shall exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may
317 fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that
318 nothing contained in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of the
319 authority to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost
320 resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such
321 notices and in the petition and complaint.
322 SECTION 8.
323 Purpose and declaration of need.
324 The revitalization and redevelopment of the development area as defined in this Act shall
325 develop and promote trade, commerce, industry, and employment opportunities for the public
326 good and general welfare and promote the general welfare of the state by creating a climate
327 favorable to the location of new industry, trade, and commerce and the development of
328 existing industry, trade, and commerce within the development area and the State of Georgia.
329 Revitalization and redevelopment of the development area by financing projects under this
330 Act shall develop and promote, for the public good and general welfare, trade, commerce,
331 industry, employment opportunities, and the general welfare of the state. It is therefore in
332 the public interest and is vital to the public welfare of the people of Georgia, and it is
333 declared to be the public purpose of this Act, to so revitalize and redevelop the development
334 area. No bonds, notes, or other obligations (except refunding bonds) shall be issued by the
335 authority hereunder unless its board of directors adopts a resolution finding that the project
336 for which such bonds, notes, or other obligations are to be issued shall promote the foregoing
337 objectives.
