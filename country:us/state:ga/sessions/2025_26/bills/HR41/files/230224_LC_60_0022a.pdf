By: Representatives Schofield of the 63rd, Mathiak of the 82nd, Jackson of the 68th, Scott of
the 76th, Davis of the 87th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Urging Congress to reduce the waiting period for determination and approval of disability
2 benefits for individuals living with lupus; to ensure equitable access to essential disability
3 benefits for such individuals; and for other purposes.
4 WHEREAS, lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple systems in the body,
5 often resulting in severe pain, fatigue, organ damage, and life-altering complications; and
6 WHEREAS, the unpredictable and debilitating nature of lupus frequently impairs individuals'
7 ability to maintain consistent employment, making disability benefits a critical safety net;
8 and
9 WHEREAS, the current Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security
10 Income approval processes often involve significant delays, exacerbating the financial and
11 emotional strain on individuals living with lupus; and
12 WHEREAS, individuals with lupus face unique challenges in documenting their condition
13 due to the disease's complexity, variability, and often subjective symptoms, contributing to
14 high rates of initial claim denials and prolonged appeals processes; and
