A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Part 4 of Article 6 of Chapter 2 of Title 20 of the Official Code of Georgia
2 Annotated, relating to financing under the "Quality Basic Education Act," so as to revise
3 QBE program weights based on recommendations of the 2015 Education Reform
4 Commission; to provide for related matters; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other
5 purposes.
6 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
7 SECTION 1.
8 Part 4 of Article 6 of Chapter 2 of Title 20 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated,
9 relating to financing under the "Quality Basic Education Act," is amended by revising Code
10 Section 20-2-161, relating to the Quality Basic Education Formula, as follows:
11 "20-2-161.
12 (a) The high middle school general education program is declared to be the base program
13 against which the cost of all other instructional programs shall be compared. The amount
14 of funds needed by each full-time equivalent student in the base program, in order that such
15 program can be sufficiently funded to provide quality basic education to all enrolled
16 students, shall be known as the 'base amount' and shall reflect program components which

17 constitute the program weight for the high middle school general education program in
18 Code Sections 20-2-182 through 20-2-186. However, the General Assembly shall annually
19 establish through the General Appropriations Act the base amount to be used each year.
20 In the event that the base amount so established when multiplied by the program weights
21 in subsection (b) of this Code section requires funds in excess of the appropriation for the
22 Quality Basic Education Formula grants, the funds which are appropriated for the Quality
23 Basic Education Formula shall be prorated to each of the Quality Basic Education Formula
24 cost categories.
25 (b) As the cost of instructional programs varies depending upon the teacher-student ratios
26 and specific services typically required to address the special needs of students enrolled,
27 state authorized instructional programs shall have the following program weights and
28 teacher-student ratios:
29 (1) Kindergarten program . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.6901

124 (d) The total funds needed for the Quality Basic Education Program for each local school
125 system shall be calculated annually. Such total shall represent the product of the following
126 calculations for each of the programs identified in subsection (b) of this Code section:
127 (1) Multiply the average full-time equivalent program count pursuant to subsection (b)
128 of Code Section 20-2-160 by the respective program weight established in subsection (b)
129 of this Code section;
130 (2) Multiply the product computed in paragraph (1) of this subsection by the base
131 amount as established in the General Appropriations Act; and
132 (3) Add the product computed in paragraph (2) of this subsection to the program
133 adjustment amount for training and experience for the instructional program in
134 accordance with subsection (e) of this Code section.
135 The process and associated components contained within this Code section shall be known
136 as the 'Quality Basic Education Formula.'
137 (e) The State Board of Education shall annually calculate for each instructional program
138 provided for in subsection (b) of this Code section for each local school system the amount
139 of additional funds needed beyond the amounts reflected in the base amount and the
140 program weights, in order to pay the state minimum salaries pursuant to Code
141 Section 20-2-212. The calculation of such additional amount shall be based on all
142 certificated professional personnel who were employed by the local school system as of the
143 month of October for the most recent year that these data are available; provided, however,
144 that the amount needed for training and experience for personnel funded through
145 categorical grants shall only be included in the appropriate categorical grant. The amount
146 shall be reported for each program identified in subsection (b) of this Code section for each
147 full-time equivalent program count date and by segment of the school day and for each
H. B. 796

25 LC 61 0230
148 categorical program. Such additional amount shall be known as 'program adjustment
149 amount for training and experience' and this amount shall be noted in total in the language
150 section of the General Appropriations Act each year.
151 (f) As the relative costs of the various program components will change over time and as
152 some components will need to be added or removed, the Governor shall appoint a task
153 force every three years for the purposes of reviewing the effectiveness of existing program
154 weights and recommending to the General Assembly any changes needed. This task force
155 shall be comprised of members or staff of the General Assembly, the State Board of
156 Education, the Governor's office, and representatives of local school systems."
157 SECTION 2.
158 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
