House Bill 166
By: Representatives Franklin of the 160th, Corbett of the 174th, Hagan of the 156th, Buckner
of the 137th, Smith of the 138th, and others
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Chapter 4 of Title 1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to
2 holidays and observances, so as to designate the fourth Friday in November of each year as
3 "National Sugarcane Syrup Day" in Georgia; to provide legislative findings and declarations;
4 to provide for related matters; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.
5 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
6 SECTION 1.
7 The General Assembly finds that:
8 (1) Making sugarcane syrup has been a part of family farm tradition for generations,
9 particularly in Georgia;
10 (2) The increase in production costs, competition from artificial syrups, and the decreasing
11 number of farmers who still make sugarcane syrup, however, has led some to refer to the
12 making of sugarcane syrup as a dying art;
13 (3) Establishing a "National Sugarcane Syrup Day" in Georgia would help to preserve the
14 art of making sugarcane syrup by honoring those who continue with this long-standing
15 family farm tradition and by raising public awareness of the differences between natural
16 sugarcane syrup and artificial syrups;

17 (4) Designating the fourth Friday in November of each year, the day after Thanksgiving,
18 as "National Sugarcane Syrup Day" is particularly fitting, as it is not only a time when
19 families gather and celebrate together, but also a time when some say sugarcane is at its
20 sweetest in Georgia; and
21 (5) It is, therefore, abundantly fitting and proper that the State of Georgia appropriately
22 recognize and honor the family farm tradition of making sugarcane syrup by designating
23 the fourth Friday in November of each year as "National Sugarcane Syrup Day" in Georgia.
24 SECTION 2.
25 Chapter 4 of Title 1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to holidays and
26 observances, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
27 "1-4-27.
28 The fourth Friday in November of each year is designated as 'National Sugarcane Syrup
29 Day' in Georgia."
30 SECTION 3.
31 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
