14 "20-2-149.3.
15 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
16 (1) Education in computer science is a critical need for the students of Georgia for the
17 twenty-first century; and
H. B. 487

25 LC 49 2261
18 (2) Less than 0.5 percent of high school graduates have taken a computer science course;
19 (3) There are thousands of unfulfilled computer science jobs in the state; and
20 (4) The logical critical thinking skills taught by computer science are now very valuable
21 in many noncomputer science jobs, as technology has become embedded in most
22 professions.
23 (b) As used in this Code section, the term:
24 (1) 'Computer science' means the study of computers, algorithmic processes, coding,
25 artificial intelligence, emerging technologies, and logical critical thinking, including
26 computer principles, their hardware and software designs, their implementation, and their
27 impact on society.

29 computer science as stand-alone implementations and middle school courses that provide
30 instruction in computer science in stand-alone implementations or by being embedded
31 in other subjects and focus on how to create and understand technology, rather than by
32 simply using technology.
33 (3) 'High-quality professional learning' means professional development activities that:
34 (A) Clarify the conceptual foundations of computer science;
35 (B) Teach research based practices, including hands-on and inquiry based learning; and
36 (C) Are intended for teachers with or without prior exposure to computer science.
37 (4) 'High-quality professional learning providers' means institutions of higher education
38 in this state, local school systems, nonprofit organizations, or private entities that have
39 successfully designed, implemented, and scaled high-quality professional learning for
40 teachers and are approved or recommended by the State Board of Education in
41 coordination with the Department of Education.
42 (5) 'Offer' means providing a course taught by a computer science teacher:
43 (A) Who is onsite at the physical location of the school; or
H. B. 487

50 offer instruction in exploratory computer science;
51 (C) Each state charter school that serves high school students shall offer a course in
52 computer science;
53 (D) Each state charter school that serves middle school students shall offer instruction
54 in exploratory computer science;
55 (E) Each local school system may provide that all elementary schools in its school
56 system offer instruction in exploratory computer science; and
57 (F) Each state charter school that serves elementary school students may offer
58 instruction in exploratory computer science.
59 (2) Beginning in the 2023-2024 school year, each local school system shall provide that
60 at least 50 percent of the high schools in its school system offer a course in computer
61 science.
62 (3) Beginning in the 2024-2025 school year, each local school system shall provide that
63 all high schools in its school system offer a course in computer science.
64 (4)(A) Beginning in the 2031-2032 school year, each local board of education shall
65 require all students, as a condition of graduation from high school, to complete a course
66 in computer science or a career, technical, and agricultural education (CTAE) course
67 embedded with computer science which meets the requirements provided in
68 subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
69 (B) The course required in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may be earned by
