House Resolution 262
68th, Davis of the 87th, and others
A RESOLUTION

3 WHEREAS, on Thursday, February 13, 2025, Representative Kim Schofield and the Georgia
4 Chapter of the Lupus Foundation of America will host Lupus Advocacy Day at the state
5 capitol; and
6 WHEREAS, lupus is an acute and chronic (lifelong) autoimmune disease in which the
7 immune system is unbalanced, causing inflammation and tissue damage to virtually every
8 organ system in the body; and
9 WHEREAS, lupus can affect any part of the body, including the skin, lungs, heart, kidneys,
10 and brain, and thus has the potential to cause seizures, strokes, heart attacks, miscarriages,

25 LC 112 2975
14 WHEREAS, lupus is a major health issue that has a significant impact on the economy of
15 this state and takes an immeasurable physical, financial, and emotional toll on many families
16 in Georgia; and
17 WHEREAS, the effects of lupus on a family can be devastating in that it is a chronic,
18 lifelong, and life-threatening disease, and despite its prevalence, it remains one of the least
19 recognizable and most misunderstood of all diseases, labeling lupus as the cruel mystery; and
20 WHEREAS, lupus affects primarily young women in their crucial childbearing years, but it
21 can also affect men, children, and women of all ages; and
22 WHEREAS, Lupus Nephritis, a form of kidney disease, is a serious, life-threatening
23 complication of lupus. The need for screening in lupus for Lupus Nephritis is crucial for
24 early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Georgia Medicaid has the opportunity to play a
25 meaningful role in addressing the problem of insufficient screening by emphasizing its
26 importance to patients and healthcare providers. By doing so, Georgia Medicaid can help
27 improve patient outcomes and make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by lupus
28 and Lupus Nephritis; and
29 WHEREAS, the Lupus Foundation of America is the nation's leading nonprofit voluntary
30 health organization dedicated to finding the causes and a cure for lupus while providing
31 support and services to all people affected by lupus; and
32 WHEREAS, 90 percent of every dollar raised by the Georgia Chapter of the Lupus
33 Foundation of America stays in Georgia to support the chapter's programs; and

25 LC 112 2975
34 WHEREAS, the Lupus Foundation of America provides resources for thousands of patients
35 and families, including support and information, physician referrals, public and professional
36 education, and grassroots advocacy on the state and federal level; and
37 WHEREAS, in 2014, Governor Nathan Deal established the Georgia Council on Lupus
38 Education and Advocacy to investigate the level of education and awareness of lupus across
39 the state; and
40 WHEREAS, the council has developed a state-wide action plan and established a
41 multidisciplinary collaborative that will launch lupus initiatives to increase knowledge,
42 educate healthcare providers, consumers, and legislators, and address early diagnosis, access
43 to care, and health disparities in lupus.
44 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
45 the members of this body commend the work of the Lupus Foundation of America and other
46 organizations devoted to finding a cure for lupus and supporting the individuals and families
47 whose lives are affected by this autoimmune disease and recognize February 13, 2025, as
48 Lupus Advocacy Day at the state capitol.
49 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
50 and directed to make an appropriate copy of this resolution available for distribution to the
51 Georgia Chapter of the Lupus Foundation of America.
