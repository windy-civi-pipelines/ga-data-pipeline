A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing April 2025 as Autism Acceptance Month and April 2, 2025, as World Autism
2 Awareness Day; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex, lifelong developmental condition
4 that affects individuals in varying ways, influencing social interaction, communication, and
5 behavior across a broad spectrum of strengths and challenges; and
6 WHEREAS, autism can be characterized by persistent differences in communication and
7 social interaction, including nonverbal communication challenges, difficulty interpreting
8 social cues, and repetitive behaviors or intense interests, along with unique sensory
9 processing needs; and
10 WHEREAS, early screening and intervention are critical for children with autism, as children
11 diagnosed by age four are more likely to receive necessary services that can significantly
12 improve long-term outcomes; and
13 WHEREAS, numerous evidence-based interventions—including applied behavior analysis
14 (ABA), speech therapy, occupational therapy, and social skills training—have proven
15 effective in promoting independence and reducing disruptive behaviors; and
