17 revising Code Section 9-10-184, relating to value of pain and suffering may be argued, as
18 follows:
19 "9-10-184.
20 (a) As used in this Code section, the term:
21 (1) 'Economic damages' means pecuniary damages recoverable in tort for bodily injury
22 or wrongful death, including, but not limited to, damages for past and future medical
23 expenses; costs of rehabilitation; costs of therapy; loss of wages; loss of income; loss of
24 earning capacity; loss of services performed by the injured or deceased person as a result
25 of the injury or death, including domestic and other necessary services performed without
26 compensation; and funeral or burial expenses.
27 (2) 'Noneconomic damages' means all damages recoverable in tort for bodily injury or
28 wrongful death other than economic damages, including, but not limited to, damages for
29 physical or emotional pain, discomfort, anxiety, hardship, distress, suffering,
30 inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment
31 of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, injury to reputation, and
32 in wrongful death cases, the nonpecuniary elements of the full value of life.
33 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this Code section, in the trial of any
34 action to recover damages for bodily injury or wrongful death, counsel shall not argue the
35 worth or monetary value of noneconomic damages, and counsel shall not, in the hearing
36 of the jury or any prospective juror, elicit any testimony regarding, or make any reference
37 to, any specific amount or range of amounts of noneconomic damages, the measure of such
38 damages being the enlightened conscience of an impartial jury.
39 (c)(1) In the trial of any action to recover damages for bodily injury or wrongful death,
40 counsel for any party shall be allowed to argue the worth or monetary value of
41 noneconomic damages only after the close of evidence and at the time of such party's
S. B. 68
- 2 -
25 LC 49 2362S
42 first opportunity to argue the issue of damages, provided that such argument shall be
43 rationally related to the evidence of noneconomic damages and shall not make reference
44 to objects or values having no rational connection to the facts proved by the evidence.
45 (2) If counsel is entitled to the opening and concluding arguments, then counsel shall not
46 be allowed to argue the worth or monetary value of noneconomic damages during such
47 counsel's concluding argument unless counsel has argued the worth or monetary value
48 of noneconomic damages during such counsel's opening argument, and such counsel shall
49 not argue a different worth or monetary value of noneconomic damages in concluding
50 arguments than was argued in such counsel's opening argument.
51 (d) If counsel elicits any testimony, or makes any argument or reference, prohibited by this
52 Code section in the hearing of the jury or one or more prospective jurors, the court shall
53 take remedial measures as provided in Code Section 9-10-185 or shall, with respect to
54 prospective jurors, excuse the prospective jurors.
55 (e) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to prohibit counsel from asking
56 prospective jurors during voir dire whether they could return a verdict that does not award
57 any damages or a verdict in excess of some unspecified amount, provided that such
58 question is supported by the evidence. In the trial of a civil action for personal injuries,
59 counsel shall be allowed to argue the worth or monetary value of pain and suffering to the
60 jury; provided, however, that any such argument shall conform to the evidence or
61 reasonable deductions from the evidence in the case."
62 SECTION 2.
63 Said title is further amended in Code Section 9-11-12, relating to answer, defenses, and
64 objections, when and how presented and heard, when defenses waived, and stay of discovery,

68 an answer within 30 days after the service of the summons and complaint upon him the
69 defendant, unless otherwise provided by statute. A cross-claim or counterclaim shall not
70 require an answer, unless one is required by order of the court, and shall automatically
71 stand denied.
72 (2) Unless the court sets a different time, serving a motion under this Code section alters
73 the time for serving an answer pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection as follows:
74 (A) If the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until trial, the answer
75 shall be served within 15 days after notice of the court's action; or
76 (B) If the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the answer shall be
77 served within 15 days after the more definite statement is served."
78 "(e) Motion for more definite statement. If a pleading to which a responsive pleading
79 is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame
80 a proper responsive pleading, he shall nevertheless answer or respond to the best of his
81 ability, and he such party may move for a more definite statement. The motion shall point
82 out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order
83 of the court is not obeyed within 15 days after notice of the order, or within such other time
84 as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or
85 make such order as it deems just."
86 "(j) Stay of discovery.
87 (1) If a party files a motion to dismiss before or at the time of filing an answer and
88 pursuant to the provisions of this Code section, discovery shall be stayed for 90 days after
89 the filing of such motion or until the ruling of the court on such motion; provided,

91 motion, the stay imposed by this subsection shall immediately terminate with respect to
92 such defendant, whichever is sooner. The court shall decide the motion to dismiss within

94 motion.
95 (2) The discovery period and all discovery deadlines shall be extended for a period equal
96 to the duration of the stay imposed by this subsection.
97 (3) If the court has not ruled on the motion to dismiss within 90 days following the
98 conclusion of briefing on such motion, the The court may upon its own motion or upon
99 motion of a party, and for good cause shown, terminate or modify the stay imposed by
100 this subsection but shall not extend such stay; provided, however, that such remedy shall
101 not preclude any other remedy available for the failure to timely rule on such motion,
102 including, but not limited to, a writ of mandamus.
103 (4) If a motion to dismiss raises defenses set forth in paragraph (2), (3), (5), or (7) of
104 subsection (b) of this Code section; or if any party needs discovery in order to identify
105 persons who may be joined or substituted as proper parties; or if any party needs
106 discovery in order to establish the jurisdiction of the court, limited discovery needed to
107 respond to such defenses, to or identify such persons, or to establish such jurisdiction
108 shall be permitted until the court rules on such motion notwithstanding the stay imposed
109 by this subsection.
110 (5) The provisions of this subsection shall not modify or affect the provisions of
111 paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of Code Section 9-11-23 or any other power of the court
112 to stay discovery."

118 Section 9-11-23, Code Section 9-11-66, and any statute, an action may be dismissed by
119 the plaintiff, without order or permission of court:

121 the sixtieth day following the date the opposing party serves an answer; or
122 (B) By filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the
123 action.
124 (2) Effect. A dismissal under paragraph (1) of this subsection is without prejudice,
125 except that if the plaintiff previously dismissed any federal or state court action based on

127 the merits.

129 action shall not be dismissed upon the plaintiff's motion except upon order of the court
130 and upon the terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been
131 pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon him or her of the plaintiff's motion to
132 dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the
133 counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless the
134 court order states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.
135 (3) Effect. A dismissal under this subsection is without prejudice, except that the filing
136 of a second notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits."

143 of attorney's fees, court costs, or expenses of litigation, whether such statute or statutes
144 authorize such awards for compensatory or punitive purposes, unless the statute or statutes
145 specifically authorize the recovery of duplicate attorney's fees, court costs, or expenses of
146 litigation.
147 (b) In any civil action, if a party seeks to recover attorney's fees pursuant to any statute
148 authorizing an award of reasonable attorney's fees, a contingent fee agreement between
149 such party and such party's attorney shall not be admissible as proof of the reasonableness
150 of the fees.
151 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall limit or diminish any contractual right to recover
152 attorney's fees, court costs, or expenses of litigation."
153 SECTION 5.
154 Title 40 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to motor vehicles, is amended
155 in Code Section 40-8-76.1, relating to use of safety belts in passenger vehicles, by revising
156 subsection (d) as follows:
157 "(d)(1) The failure of an occupant of a motor vehicle to wear a seat safety belt in any seat
158 of a motor vehicle which has a seat safety belt or belts shall not be considered evidence
159 of negligence or causation, shall not otherwise be considered by the finder of fact on any
160 question of liability of any person, corporation, or insurer, shall not be any basis for
161 cancellation of coverage or increase in insurance rates, and shall not may be considered
162 in any civil action as evidence admissible on the issues of negligence, comparative
163 negligence, causation, assumption of risk, or apportionment of fault or for any other
164 purpose and may be evidence used to diminish any recovery for damages arising out of
165 the ownership, maintenance, occupancy, or operation of a motor vehicle; provided,
166 however, that this paragraph shall not prevent a court from determining the admissibility
167 of such evidence pursuant to Code Section 24-4-403 or any other statutory or common
168 law rule of evidence.

193 clear danger to the safety of persons upon the premises, such information being specific
194 as to the identity of the third person, the nature and character of the wrongful conduct, the

228 in such wrongful conduct upon the premises, based on:

245 the vicinity of the premises;

258 (2) The injury sustained by the licensee was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of
259 such wrongful conduct by a third person;
260 (3) Such wrongful conduct by a third person was a reasonably foreseeable consequence
261 of such third person exploiting a specific physical condition of the premises known to the
262 owner or occupier, which created a reasonably foreseeable risk of wrongful conduct on

266 or mitigate the specific and known physical condition of the premises and to otherwise

303 victim of a violation of Code Section 16-5-46;
304 (6) Arising from an injury sustained upon premises that is used as a single-family
305 residence; or
306 (7) Based on a particularized warning of imminent wrongful conduct by a third person,

317 from wrongful conduct by a third person, the trier of fact shall consider the security
318 measures employed by the owner or occupier at the time of the injury from which the claim
319 of negligent security arises, the need for additional or other security measures, the
320 practicality of additional or other security measures, whether additional or other security

325 In any action for negligent security:

327 shall make an apportionment of fault under Code Section 51-12-33, and in making such
328 an apportionment, the trier of fact shall reasonably apportion fault to:
329 (A) The owner or occupier;
330 (B) Any third person whose wrongful conduct was a cause of the injury from which
331 the claim of negligent security arises; and
332 (C) Any other persons to whom fault otherwise should be apportioned under Code
333 Section 51-12-33;
334 (2) In connection with an apportionment of fault under Code Section 51-12-33, no party

339 wrongful conduct from which the claim of negligent security arises;
340 (B) The financial resources of any party or nonparty; or

344 person whose wrongful conduct was a cause of the injury from which the claim of
345 negligent security arises, the trial court shall set aside the verdict of the jury and order a
346 retrial of liability and damages. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an
S. B. 68
- 14 -
25 LC 49 2362S
347 apportionment of fault is unreasonable if the total percentage of fault apportioned to all
348 third persons for their wrongful conduct is less than the total percentage of fault
349 apportioned to all owners or occupiers, security contractors, and other persons and
350 entities that did not engage in wrongful conduct.
351 51-3-57.

353 all or part of a premises of an owner or occupier safe from the wrongful conduct of a third
354 person, the security contractor may be liable for negligent security only in the same
355 manner, to the same extent, and subject to the same limitations and provisions applicable
356 to an owner or occupier contained in this article. In no event shall a security contractor be
357 subject to liability for negligent security to an extent greater than the liability for negligent
358 security of an owner or occupier.
359 (b) No security contractor shall be liable for negligent security except as provided in this
360 Code section.
361 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall limit or otherwise affect any claim or remedy of an
362 owner or occupier for breach of contract."
363 SECTION 7.
364 Said title is further amended in Article 1 of Chapter 12, relating to general provisions relative
365 to damages, by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
366 "51-12-1.1.
367 (a) In any civil action to recover damages resulting from injury or death to a person,
368 special damages for medical and healthcare expenses shall be recoverable only as provided
369 in this Code section.

370 (b) Special damages for medical and healthcare expenses shall be limited to the reasonable
371 value of medically necessary care, treatment, or services, and the amount of such special
372 damages shall be determined by the trier of fact.
373 (c) If the plaintiff in any such civil action has any form of public or private health
374 insurance, including benefits under a governmental workers' compensation program,
375 evidence relevant to the determination of the reasonable value of medically necessary care,
376 treatment, or services pursuant to subsection (b) of this Code section shall include both the
377 amounts charged for past, present, or future medical and healthcare expenses and the
378 amounts actually necessary to satisfy such charges pursuant to the insurance contract or the
379 applicable governmental workers' compensation program, regardless of whether the health
380 insurance has been used, is used, or will be used to satisfy such charges.
381 (d) In any claim for medical and healthcare expenses rendered under a letter of protection
382 or any other arrangement by which a healthcare provider renders treatment in exchange for
383 a promise of payment for the plaintiff's medical and healthcare expenses from any

396 (4) Whether the claimant was referred for treatment under a letter of protection or other
397 similar arrangement and, if so, the identity of the person who made the referral.
398 (e) It is the intent of the General Assembly that this Code section abrogates the common
399 law collateral source rule to the extent necessary to introduce the evidence described in this
400 Code section; provided, however, that nothing in this Code section shall be construed or
401 applied to prevent the court from issuing appropriate jury instructions to clarify the role of
402 collateral source payments and to prevent potential jury confusion regarding the effect of
403 collateral source payments on the plaintiff's recovery.
404 (f) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed or applied to limit the right of a plaintiff
405 or defendant to present evidence or testimony, or both, challenging the reasonableness of

407 medical necessity of any treatment."
408 SECTION 8.

413 of damages determined at trial in the following manner:
414 (1) In the first phase of the trial, the trier of fact shall determine the fault of each
415 defendant, and if the trier of fact finds that any defendant is at fault for the plaintiff's
416 injuries or wrongful death, the trier of fact shall further determine through an appropriate
417 form of the verdict the percentages of fault of all persons or entities that contributed to
418 such injuries or wrongful death as provided in Code Section 51-12-33, prior to any
419 determination of the total amount of damages to be awarded, if any such findings are
420 required. The evidence and arguments of counsel in the first phase of the trial shall be
421 limited to the issues provided for in this paragraph;
S. B. 68
- 17 -
25 LC 49 2362S
422 (2) If the trier of fact finds in the first phase of the trial that any defendant is at fault for
423 the plaintiff's injuries or wrongful death, the trial shall be recommenced immediately with
424 the same judge and the same jury. In the second phase of the trial, the trier of fact shall
425 determine all compensatory damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, if any, and the
426 evidence and arguments of counsel shall be limited to this issue; and
427 (3) If the trier of fact finds in the second phase of the trial that any compensatory
428 damages are to be awarded to the plaintiff, the trial may be recommenced immediately
429 with the same judge and the same jury for such further proceedings as may be required,
430 including, but not limited to, proceedings provided for in subsection (d) of Code Section

440 or
441 (2) The amount in controversy is less than $150,000.00."
442 SECTION 9.
443 (a) This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming
444 law without such approval.
445 (b) Sections 6 and 7 of this Act shall apply only with respect to causes of action arising on

25 LC 49 2362S
15 SECTION 1.
16 Title 9 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to civil practice, is amended by
17 revising Code Section 9-10-184, relating to value of pain and suffering may be argued, as
18 follows:
19 "9-10-184.
20 (a) As used in this Code section, the term:
21 (1) 'Economic damages' means pecuniary damages recoverable in tort for bodily injury
22 or wrongful death, including, but not limited to, damages for past and future medical
23 expenses; costs of rehabilitation; costs of therapy; loss of wages; loss of income; loss of
24 earning capacity; loss of services performed by the injured or deceased person as a result
25 of the injury or death, including domestic and other necessary services performed without
26 compensation; and funeral or burial expenses.
27 (2) 'Noneconomic damages' means all damages recoverable in tort for bodily injury or
28 wrongful death other than economic damages, including, but not limited to, damages for
29 physical or emotional pain, discomfort, anxiety, hardship, distress, suffering,
30 inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment
31 of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, injury to reputation, and
32 in wrongful death cases, the nonpecuniary elements of the full value of life.
33 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this Code section, in the trial of any
34 action to recover damages for bodily injury or wrongful death, counsel shall not argue the
35 worth or monetary value of noneconomic damages, and counsel shall not, in the hearing
36 of the jury or any prospective juror, elicit any testimony regarding, or make any reference
37 to, any specific amount or range of amounts of noneconomic damages, the measure of such
38 damages being the enlightened conscience of an impartial jury.
39 (c)(1) In the trial of any action to recover damages for bodily injury or wrongful death,
40 counsel for any party shall be allowed to argue the worth or monetary value of
41 noneconomic damages only after the close of evidence and at the time of such party's
S. B. 68
- 2 -

25 LC 49 2362S
42 first opportunity to argue the issue of damages, provided that such argument shall be
43 rationally related to the evidence of noneconomic damages and shall not make reference
44 to objects or values having no rational connection to the facts proved by the evidence.
45 (2) If counsel is entitled to the opening and concluding arguments, then counsel shall not
46 be allowed to argue the worth or monetary value of noneconomic damages during such
47 counsel's concluding argument unless counsel has argued the worth or monetary value
48 of noneconomic damages during such counsel's opening argument, and such counsel shall
49 not argue a different worth or monetary value of noneconomic damages in concluding
50 arguments than was argued in such counsel's opening argument.
51 (d) If counsel elicits any testimony, or makes any argument or reference, prohibited by this
52 Code section in the hearing of the jury or one or more prospective jurors, the court shall
53 take remedial measures as provided in Code Section 9-10-185 or shall, with respect to
54 prospective jurors, excuse the prospective jurors.
55 (e) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to prohibit counsel from asking
56 prospective jurors during voir dire whether they could return a verdict that does not award
57 any damages or a verdict in excess of some unspecified amount, provided that such
58 question is supported by the evidence. In the trial of a civil action for personal injuries,
59 counsel shall be allowed to argue the worth or monetary value of pain and suffering to the
60 jury; provided, however, that any such argument shall conform to the evidence or
61 reasonable deductions from the evidence in the case."
62 SECTION 2.
63 Said title is further amended in Code Section 9-11-12, relating to answer, defenses, and
64 objections, when and how presented and heard, when defenses waived, and stay of discovery,
65 by revising subsections (a), (e), and (j) as follows:
66 "(a) When answer presented.

67 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a A defendant shall serve his
68 an answer within 30 days after the service of the summons and complaint upon him the
69 defendant, unless otherwise provided by statute. A cross-claim or counterclaim shall not
70 require an answer, unless one is required by order of the court, and shall automatically
71 stand denied.
72 (2) Unless the court sets a different time, serving a motion under this Code section alters
73 the time for serving an answer pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection as follows:
74 (A) If the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until trial, the answer
75 shall be served within 15 days after notice of the court's action; or
76 (B) If the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the answer shall be
77 served within 15 days after the more definite statement is served."
78 "(e) Motion for more definite statement. If a pleading to which a responsive pleading
79 is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame
80 a proper responsive pleading, he shall nevertheless answer or respond to the best of his
81 ability, and he such party may move for a more definite statement. The motion shall point
82 out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order
83 of the court is not obeyed within 15 days after notice of the order, or within such other time
84 as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or
85 make such order as it deems just."
86 "(j) Stay of discovery.
87 (1) If a party files a motion to dismiss before or at the time of filing an answer and
88 pursuant to the provisions of this Code section, discovery shall be stayed for 90 days after
89 the filing of such motion or until the ruling of the court on such motion; provided,
90 however, that, if a defendant files an answer before the ruling of the court on such
91 motion, the stay imposed by this subsection shall immediately terminate with respect to
92 such defendant, whichever is sooner. The court shall decide the motion to dismiss within
S. B. 68

25 LC 49 2362S
93 the 90 days provided in this paragraph following the conclusion of briefing on such
94 motion.
95 (2) The discovery period and all discovery deadlines shall be extended for a period equal
96 to the duration of the stay imposed by this subsection.
97 (3) If the court has not ruled on the motion to dismiss within 90 days following the
98 conclusion of briefing on such motion, the The court may upon its own motion or upon
99 motion of a party, and for good cause shown, terminate or modify the stay imposed by
100 this subsection but shall not extend such stay; provided, however, that such remedy shall
101 not preclude any other remedy available for the failure to timely rule on such motion,
102 including, but not limited to, a writ of mandamus.
103 (4) If a motion to dismiss raises defenses set forth in paragraph (2), (3), (5), or (7) of
104 subsection (b) of this Code section; or if any party needs discovery in order to identify
105 persons who may be joined or substituted as proper parties; or if any party needs
106 discovery in order to establish the jurisdiction of the court, limited discovery needed to
107 respond to such defenses, to or identify such persons, or to establish such jurisdiction
108 shall be permitted until the court rules on such motion notwithstanding the stay imposed
109 by this subsection.
110 (5) The provisions of this subsection shall not modify or affect the provisions of
111 paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of Code Section 9-11-23 or any other power of the court
112 to stay discovery."
113 SECTION 3.

118 Section 9-11-23, Code Section 9-11-66, and any statute, an action may be dismissed by
119 the plaintiff, without order or permission of court:
120 (A) By filing a written notice of dismissal at any time before the first witness is sworn
121 the sixtieth day following the date the opposing party serves an answer; or
122 (B) By filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the
123 action.
124 (2) Effect. A dismissal under paragraph (1) of this subsection is without prejudice,
125 except that if the plaintiff previously dismissed any federal or state court action based on
126 or including the same claim, such notice or stipulation operates as an adjudication upon
127 the merits.
128 (2)(3) By order of court. Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, an
129 action shall not be dismissed upon the plaintiff's motion except upon order of the court
130 and upon the terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been
131 pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon him or her of the plaintiff's motion to
132 dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the
133 counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless the
134 court order states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.
135 (3) Effect. A dismissal under this subsection is without prejudice, except that the filing
136 of a second notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits."
137 SECTION 4.
138 Said title is further amended in Chapter 15, relating to court and litigation costs, by adding
139 a new Code section to read as follows:
140 "9-15-16.

S. B. 68
- 6 -

25 LC 49 2362S
143 of attorney's fees, court costs, or expenses of litigation, whether such statute or statutes
144 authorize such awards for compensatory or punitive purposes, unless the statute or statutes
145 specifically authorize the recovery of duplicate attorney's fees, court costs, or expenses of
146 litigation.
147 (b) In any civil action, if a party seeks to recover attorney's fees pursuant to any statute
148 authorizing an award of reasonable attorney's fees, a contingent fee agreement between
149 such party and such party's attorney shall not be admissible as proof of the reasonableness
150 of the fees.
151 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall limit or diminish any contractual right to recover
152 attorney's fees, court costs, or expenses of litigation."
153 SECTION 5.

155 in Code Section 40-8-76.1, relating to use of safety belts in passenger vehicles, by revising
156 subsection (d) as follows:
157 "(d)(1) The failure of an occupant of a motor vehicle to wear a seat safety belt in any seat
158 of a motor vehicle which has a seat safety belt or belts shall not be considered evidence
159 of negligence or causation, shall not otherwise be considered by the finder of fact on any
160 question of liability of any person, corporation, or insurer, shall not be any basis for
161 cancellation of coverage or increase in insurance rates, and shall not may be considered
162 in any civil action as evidence admissible on the issues of negligence, comparative
163 negligence, causation, assumption of risk, or apportionment of fault or for any other
164 purpose and may be evidence used to diminish any recovery for damages arising out of
165 the ownership, maintenance, occupancy, or operation of a motor vehicle; provided,
166 however, that this paragraph shall not prevent a court from determining the admissibility
167 of such evidence pursuant to Code Section 24-4-403 or any other statutory or common
168 law rule of evidence.
S. B. 68

25 LC 49 2362S
169 (2) The failure of an occupant of a motor vehicle to wear a seat safety belt in any seat of
170 a motor vehicle which has a seat safety belt or belts shall not be any basis for a
171 cancellation of insurance coverage or an increase in insurance rate."

S. B. 68
- 8 -

25 LC 49 2362S
193 clear danger to the safety of persons upon the premises, such information being specific
194 as to the identity of the third person, the nature and character of the wrongful conduct, the

205 presented by such wrongful conduct, and to understand that a specific and known

228 in such wrongful conduct upon the premises, based on:

231 (ii) Prior occurrences of substantially similar wrongful conduct upon the property
232 adjoining the premises, or otherwise occurring within 500 yards of the premises, of

237 be upon the premises and if the owner or occupier had actual knowledge of such prior
238 occurrences of substantially similar wrongful conduct;
239 (2) The injury sustained by the invitee was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of such
240 wrongful conduct by a third person;
241 (3) Such wrongful conduct by a third person was a reasonably foreseeable consequence

243 owner or occupier, which created a reasonably foreseeable risk of wrongful conduct on
244 the premises that was substantially greater than the general risk of wrongful conduct in
245 the vicinity of the premises;

- 10 -

25 LC 49 2362S
246 (4) The owner or occupier failed to exercise ordinary care to remedy or mitigate such
247 specific and known physical condition of the premises and to otherwise keep the premises

254 owner or occupier as a licensee if the plaintiff proves that:
255 (1) The wrongful conduct by a third person that caused the injury sustained by the
256 licensee was reasonably foreseeable because the owner or occupier had particularized
257 warning of imminent wrongful conduct by a third person;
258 (2) The injury sustained by the licensee was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of
259 such wrongful conduct by a third person;
260 (3) Such wrongful conduct by a third person was a reasonably foreseeable consequence
261 of such third person exploiting a specific physical condition of the premises known to the
262 owner or occupier, which created a reasonably foreseeable risk of wrongful conduct on
263 the premises that was substantially greater than the general risk of wrongful conduct in
264 the vicinity of the premises;
265 (4) The owner or occupier willfully and wantonly failed to exercise any care to remedy
266 or mitigate the specific and known physical condition of the premises and to otherwise
267 keep the premises safe from such wrongful conduct by a third person; and
268 (5) Such failure of the owner or occupier to exercise any care was a proximate cause of
269 the injury sustained by the licensee.

270 51-3-53.
271 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this Code section, the
272 provisions of this article shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for negligent security
273 against owners or occupiers, and no owner or occupier shall be liable for negligent security
274 except as provided in this article.
275 (b) Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect any cause of action
276 brought pursuant to Code Section 51-1-56 or any other applicable law or theory of recovery
277 otherwise recognized by law, including, but not limited to, negligence and nuisance, in
278 connection with an alleged violation of Code Section 16-5-46.
279 (c) Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect any claim or
280 remedy for breach of contract or any other claim, remedy, or cause of action not arising
281 under Article 1 of this chapter.
282 51-3-54.
283 Notwithstanding Code Sections 51-3-51 and 51-3-52, no owner or occupier shall be liable
284 for negligent security:
285 (1) Arising from an injury sustained by a person upon the premises of the owner or
286 occupier as a trespasser;
287 (2) Arising from an injury sustained by a person not upon the premises of the owner or
288 occupier;
289 (3) Arising from the wrongful conduct of a third person, if such wrongful conduct did
290 not occur upon the premises and in a place from which the owner or occupier had the
291 legal right and authority to exclude such third person;
292 (4) Arising from the wrongful conduct of a third person, if such third person was upon
293 the premises as a tenant or as a guest of a tenant, if the owner or occupier had

S. B. 68
- 12 -

25 LC 49 2362S
295 (5) Arising from an injury sustained by a third person upon the premises of the owner
296 or occupier as an invitee or a licensee, if such person:
297 (A) Came upon the premises for the purpose of committing any violation of a law of
298 this state that is punishable as a felony or any violation of Chapter 8 of Title 16 that is
299 punishable as a misdemeanor; or
300 (B) Was engaged at the time of the injury in the commission of any violation of a law
301 of this state that is punishable as a felony or any violation of Chapter 8 of Title 16 that
302 is punishable as a misdemeanor, provided that this subparagraph shall not apply to a
303 victim of a violation of Code Section 16-5-46;
304 (6) Arising from an injury sustained upon premises that is used as a single-family
305 residence; or
306 (7) Based on a particularized warning of imminent wrongful conduct by a third person,
307 if the owner or occupier made any reasonable effort to provide such information to law
308 enforcement personnel, provided that calling 9-1-1 or otherwise making a report about
309 such information to law enforcement personnel shall be deemed a reasonable effort.
310 51-3-55.
311 (a) No owner or occupier shall be required to exercise extraordinary care to keep persons
312 on or around any premises safe from wrongful conduct by a third person, and no owner or
313 occupier shall be required to assume the responsibilities and obligations of government for
314 law enforcement and public safety.
315 (b) In any action for negligent security, in assessing whether an owner or occupier has
316 breached a duty to exercise ordinary care to keep persons on or around any premises safe
317 from wrongful conduct by a third person, the trier of fact shall consider the security
318 measures employed by the owner or occupier at the time of the injury from which the claim
319 of negligent security arises, the need for additional or other security measures, the
320 practicality of additional or other security measures, whether additional or other security
S. B. 68
- 13 -

25 LC 49 2362S
321 measures would have prevented the injury, the respective responsibilities of owners or
322 occupiers with respect to the premises and government with respect to law enforcement and
323 public safety, and any other relevant circumstances.
324 51-3-56.
325 In any action for negligent security:
326 (1) If the trier of fact finds that any defendant is liable to the plaintiff, the trier of fact
327 shall make an apportionment of fault under Code Section 51-12-33, and in making such
328 an apportionment, the trier of fact shall reasonably apportion fault to:
329 (A) The owner or occupier;
330 (B) Any third person whose wrongful conduct was a cause of the injury from which
331 the claim of negligent security arises; and
332 (C) Any other persons to whom fault otherwise should be apportioned under Code
333 Section 51-12-33;
334 (2) In connection with an apportionment of fault under Code Section 51-12-33, no party
335 shall offer evidence, or make an argument or other comment in the hearing of any juror
336 or prospective juror, concerning:
337 (A) Any sentence of imprisonment or probation, fine, or other punishment that has
338 been, or could be, imposed in a criminal prosecution of any third person for the
339 wrongful conduct from which the claim of negligent security arises;
340 (B) The financial resources of any party or nonparty; or
341 (C) The effect of an apportionment of fault upon any award of damages to the plaintiff;
342 and
343 (3) If a jury fails as the trier of fact to apportion a reasonable degree of fault to the third
344 person whose wrongful conduct was a cause of the injury from which the claim of
345 negligent security arises, the trial court shall set aside the verdict of the jury and order a
346 retrial of liability and damages. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an
S. B. 68
- 14 -

25 LC 49 2362S
347 apportionment of fault is unreasonable if the total percentage of fault apportioned to all
348 third persons for their wrongful conduct is less than the total percentage of fault
349 apportioned to all owners or occupiers, security contractors, and other persons and
350 entities that did not engage in wrongful conduct.
351 51-3-57.
352 (a) If a security contractor assumes and undertakes a duty to invitees and licensees to keep
353 all or part of a premises of an owner or occupier safe from the wrongful conduct of a third
354 person, the security contractor may be liable for negligent security only in the same
355 manner, to the same extent, and subject to the same limitations and provisions applicable
356 to an owner or occupier contained in this article. In no event shall a security contractor be
357 subject to liability for negligent security to an extent greater than the liability for negligent
358 security of an owner or occupier.
359 (b) No security contractor shall be liable for negligent security except as provided in this
360 Code section.
361 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall limit or otherwise affect any claim or remedy of an
362 owner or occupier for breach of contract."
363 SECTION 7.
364 Said title is further amended in Article 1 of Chapter 12, relating to general provisions relative
365 to damages, by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
366 "51-12-1.1.
367 (a) In any civil action to recover damages resulting from injury or death to a person,
368 special damages for medical and healthcare expenses shall be recoverable only as provided
369 in this Code section.
S. B. 68
- 15 -

25 LC 49 2362S
370 (b) Special damages for medical and healthcare expenses shall be limited to the reasonable
371 value of medically necessary care, treatment, or services, and the amount of such special
372 damages shall be determined by the trier of fact.
373 (c) If the plaintiff in any such civil action has any form of public or private health
374 insurance, including benefits under a governmental workers' compensation program,
375 evidence relevant to the determination of the reasonable value of medically necessary care,
376 treatment, or services pursuant to subsection (b) of this Code section shall include both the
377 amounts charged for past, present, or future medical and healthcare expenses and the
378 amounts actually necessary to satisfy such charges pursuant to the insurance contract or the
379 applicable governmental workers' compensation program, regardless of whether the health
380 insurance has been used, is used, or will be used to satisfy such charges.
381 (d) In any claim for medical and healthcare expenses rendered under a letter of protection
382 or any other arrangement by which a healthcare provider renders treatment in exchange for
383 a promise of payment for the plaintiff's medical and healthcare expenses from any
384 judgment or settlement of a civil action to recover damages resulting from injury or death
385 to a person, regardless of how such arrangement is referred to, the following shall be
386 relevant and discoverable:
387 (1) A copy of the letter of protection;
388 (2) All charges for the plaintiff's medical and healthcare expenses, which shall be
389 itemized and, to the extent applicable, coded according to generally accepted medical
390 billing practices;
391 (3) If the healthcare provider sells the accounts receivable for the plaintiff's medical and
392 healthcare expenses to a third party at less than the invoice price:
393 (A) The name of the third party; and
394 (B) The dollar amount for which the third party purchased such accounts receivable;
395 and
S. B. 68
- 16 -

25 LC 49 2362S
396 (4) Whether the claimant was referred for treatment under a letter of protection or other
397 similar arrangement and, if so, the identity of the person who made the referral.
398 (e) It is the intent of the General Assembly that this Code section abrogates the common
399 law collateral source rule to the extent necessary to introduce the evidence described in this
400 Code section; provided, however, that nothing in this Code section shall be construed or
401 applied to prevent the court from issuing appropriate jury instructions to clarify the role of
402 collateral source payments and to prevent potential jury confusion regarding the effect of
403 collateral source payments on the plaintiff's recovery.
404 (f) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed or applied to limit the right of a plaintiff
405 or defendant to present evidence or testimony, or both, challenging the reasonableness of
406 medical and healthcare expenses, whether incurred or projected future expenses, or the
407 medical necessity of any treatment."
408 SECTION 8.
409 Said title is further amended in said article by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
410 "51-12-15.
411 (a) In any action to recover damages for bodily injury or wrongful death, any party may
412 elect, by written demand prior to the entry of the pretrial order, to have fault and any award
413 of damages determined at trial in the following manner:
414 (1) In the first phase of the trial, the trier of fact shall determine the fault of each
415 defendant, and if the trier of fact finds that any defendant is at fault for the plaintiff's
416 injuries or wrongful death, the trier of fact shall further determine through an appropriate
417 form of the verdict the percentages of fault of all persons or entities that contributed to
418 such injuries or wrongful death as provided in Code Section 51-12-33, prior to any
419 determination of the total amount of damages to be awarded, if any such findings are
420 required. The evidence and arguments of counsel in the first phase of the trial shall be
421 limited to the issues provided for in this paragraph;
S. B. 68
- 17 -

25 LC 49 2362S
422 (2) If the trier of fact finds in the first phase of the trial that any defendant is at fault for
423 the plaintiff's injuries or wrongful death, the trial shall be recommenced immediately with
424 the same judge and the same jury. In the second phase of the trial, the trier of fact shall
425 determine all compensatory damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, if any, and the
426 evidence and arguments of counsel shall be limited to this issue; and
427 (3) If the trier of fact finds in the second phase of the trial that any compensatory
428 damages are to be awarded to the plaintiff, the trial may be recommenced immediately
429 with the same judge and the same jury for such further proceedings as may be required,
430 including, but not limited to, proceedings provided for in subsection (d) of Code Section
431 51-12-5.1 concerning punitive damages and proceedings to determine liability for, and
432 the amount of, any attorney's fees, court costs, or expenses of litigation that may be
433 awarded by the trier of fact as provided by law.
434 (b) The court may reject an election by any party made pursuant to subsection (a) of this
435 Code section and order the concurrent trial of fault and damages only upon motion by any
436 party in opposition to such election and upon the court's determination that:
437 (1) The plaintiff, or if the plaintiff is the legal guardian of a minor, the minor, was
438 injured by an alleged sexual offense and would be likely to suffer serious psychological
439 or emotional distress as a result of testifying more than once in a bifurcated proceeding;
440 or
441 (2) The amount in controversy is less than $150,000.00."
442 SECTION 9.
443 (a) This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming
444 law without such approval.
445 (b) Sections 6 and 7 of this Act shall apply only with respect to causes of action arising on
446 or after the effective date of this Act, and any prior causes of action shall be governed by
447 prior law. It is the intention of the General Assembly that all other provisions of this Act
S. B. 68

25 LC 49 2362S
448 shall apply to causes of action pending on the effective date of this Act, unless such
449 application would be unconstitutional.

451 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
