324 person whose wrongful conduct was a cause of the injury from which the claim of
325 negligent security arises, the trial court shall set aside the verdict of the jury and order a
326 retrial of liability and damages. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an

329 apportioned to all owners or occupiers, security contractors, and other persons and
330 entities that did not engage in wrongful conduct.

337 subject to liability for negligent security to an extent greater than the liability for negligent
338 security of an owner or occupier.
339 (b) No security contractor shall be liable for negligent security except as provided in this
340 Code section.
341 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall limit or otherwise affect any claim or remedy of an
342 owner or occupier for breach of contract."

375 and
376 (4) Whether the claimant was referred for treatment under a letter of protection or other
377 similar arrangement and, if so, the identity of the person who made the referral.
378 (e) It is the intent of the General Assembly that this Code section abrogates the common
379 law collateral source rule to the extent necessary to introduce the evidence described in this
380 Code section; provided, however, that nothing in this Code section shall be construed or
381 applied to prevent the court from issuing appropriate jury instructions to clarify the role of
382 collateral source payments and to prevent potential jury confusion regarding the effect of
383 collateral source payments on the plaintiff's recovery.
384 (f) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed or applied to limit the right of a plaintiff
385 or defendant to present evidence or testimony, or both, challenging the reasonableness of
386 medical and healthcare expenses, whether incurred or projected future expenses, or the
387 medical necessity of any treatment."
388 SECTION 8.
389 Said title is further amended in said article by adding a new Code section to read as follows:
390 "51-12-15.
391 In any action to recover for damages for bodily injury or wrongful death, any party may
392 elect, by written demand prior to the entry of the pretrial order, to have fault and any award

25 SB 68/CSFA
394 (1) In the first phase of the trial, the trier of fact shall determine the fault of each
395 defendant, and if the trier of fact finds that any defendant is at fault for the plaintiff's
396 injuries or wrongful death, the trier of fact shall further determine through an appropriate
397 form of the verdict the percentages of fault of all persons or entities that contributed to
398 such injuries or wrongful death as provided in Code Section 51-12-33, prior to any
399 determination of the total amount of damages to be awarded, if any such findings are
400 required. The evidence and arguments of counsel in the first phase of the trial shall be
401 limited to the issues provided for in this paragraph;
402 (2) If the trier of fact finds in the first phase of the trial that any defendant is at fault for
403 the plaintiff's injuries or wrongful death, the trial shall be recommenced. In the second
404 phase of the trial, the trier of fact shall determine all compensatory damages to be
405 awarded to the plaintiff, if any, and the evidence and arguments of counsel shall be
406 limited to this issue; and
407 (3) If the trier of fact finds in the second phase of the trial that any compensatory
408 damages are to be awarded to the plaintiff, the trial may be recommenced for such further
409 proceedings as may be required, including, but not limited to, proceedings provided for
410 in subsection (d) of Code Section 51-12-5.1 concerning punitive damages and
411 proceedings to determine liability for, and the amount of, any attorney's fees, court costs,
412 or expenses of litigation that may be awarded by the trier of fact as provided by law."
413 SECTION 9.
414 (a) This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming
415 law without such approval.
416 (b) Sections 6 and 7 of this Act shall apply only with respect to causes of action arising on
417 or after the effective date of this Act, and any prior causes of action shall be governed by
418 prior law. It is the intention of the General Assembly that all other provisions of this Act
S. B. 68

419 shall apply to causes of action pending on the effective date of this Act, unless such
420 application would be unconstitutional.
421 SECTION 10.
422 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
