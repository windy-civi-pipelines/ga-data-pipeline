115 action shall not be dismissed upon the plaintiff's motion except upon order of the court

323 person whose wrongful conduct was a cause of the injury from which the claim of
324 negligent security arises, the trial court shall set aside the verdict of the jury and order a
325 retrial of liability and damages. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an

339 Code section.
340 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall limit or otherwise affect any claim or remedy of an
341 owner or occupier for breach of contract."

- 15 -

25 LC 49 2233-ECS
368 (d) If the trier of fact renders a verdict awarding any damages pursuant to subsection (b)
369 of this Code section, and if the plaintiff's charges for medically necessary care, treatment,

393 elect, by written demand prior to the entry of the pretrial order, to have fault and any award
394 of damages determined at trial in the following manner:
395 (1) In the first phase of the trial, the trier of fact shall determine the fault of each
396 defendant, and if the trier of fact finds that any defendant is at fault for the plaintiff's
397 injuries or wrongful death, the trier of fact shall further determine through an appropriate
398 form of the verdict the percentages of fault of all persons or entities that contributed to
399 such injuries or wrongful death as provided in Code Section 51-12-33, prior to any
400 determination of the total amount of damages to be awarded, if any such findings are
401 required. The evidence and arguments of counsel in the first phase of the trial shall be
402 limited to the issues provided for in this paragraph;
403 (2) If the trier of fact finds in the first phase of the trial that any defendant is at fault for
404 the plaintiff's injuries or wrongful death, the trial shall be recommenced. In the second
405 phase of the trial, the trier of fact shall determine all compensatory damages to be
406 awarded to the plaintiff, if any, and the evidence and arguments of counsel shall be
407 limited to this issue; and
408 (3) If the trier of fact finds in the second phase of the trial that any compensatory
409 damages are to be awarded to the plaintiff, the trial may be recommenced for such further
410 proceedings as may be required, including, but not limited to, proceedings provided for
411 in subsection (d) of Code Section 51-12-5.1 concerning punitive damages and
412 proceedings to determine liability for, and the amount of, any attorney's fees, court costs,
413 or expenses of litigation that may be awarded by the trier of fact as provided by law."
