104 action shall not be dismissed upon the plaintiff's motion except upon order of the court

25 LC 62 0074-EC
290 (b) In any action for negligent security, in assessing whether an owner or occupier has
291 breached a duty to exercise ordinary care to keep persons on or around any premises safe
292 from wrongful conduct by a third person, the trier of fact shall consider the security
293 measures employed by the owner or occupier at the time of the injury from which the claim
294 of negligent security arises, the need for additional or other security measures, the

313 been, or could be, imposed in a criminal prosecution of any third person for the
314 wrongful conduct from which the claim of negligent security arises;
315 (B) The financial resources of any party or nonparty; or

- 13 -
25 LC 62 0074-EC
316 (C) The effect of an apportionment of fault upon any award of damages to the plaintiff;
317 and
318 (3) If a jury fails as the trier of fact to apportion a reasonable degree of fault to the third
319 person whose wrongful conduct was a cause of the injury from which the claim of
320 negligent security arises, the trial court shall set aside the verdict of the jury and order a
321 retrial of liability and damages. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an
322 apportionment of fault is unreasonable if the total percentage of fault apportioned to all
323 third persons for their wrongful conduct is less than the total percentage of fault
324 apportioned to all owners or occupiers, security contractors, and other persons and
325 entities that did not engage in wrongful conduct.
326 51-3-57.
327 (a) If a security contractor assumes and undertakes a duty to invitees and licensees to keep
328 all or part of a premises of an owner or occupier safe from the wrongful conduct of a third
329 person, the security contractor may be liable for negligent security only in the same
330 manner, to the same extent, and subject to the same limitations and provisions applicable
331 to an owner or occupier contained in this article. In no event shall a security contractor be
332 subject to liability for negligent security to an extent greater than the liability for negligent
333 security of an owner or occupier.
334 (b) No security contractor shall be liable for negligent security except as provided in this
335 Code section.
336 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall limit or otherwise affect any claim or remedy of an
337 owner or occupier for breach of contract."

340 to damages, by adding a new Code section to read as follows:

357 insurance that is subject to Code Section 33-24-56.1, including benefits under a
358 governmental workers' compensation program, an unpaid charge for medically necessary
359 care, treatment, or services under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this Code section shall
360 be the amount by which the charge may be satisfied by the claimant's health insurance in
361 addition to the amount representing the plaintiff's responsibility for the portion of the
362 charge under the insurance contract or applicable governmental program, regardless of
363 whether the health insurance has been used, is used, or will be used to satisfy the charge.
364 (d) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to limit the right of a plaintiff or
365 defendant to present evidence or testimony, or both, challenging the reasonableness of
366 medical and healthcare expenses, whether incurred or projected future expenses, or the
367 medical necessity of any treatment."

65 out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order

81 subsection (b) of this Code section or if any party needs discovery in order to identify
82 persons who may be joined as parties, limited discovery needed to respond to such
83 defenses or identify such persons shall be permitted until the court rules on such motion.

102 the merits.

104 action shall not be dismissed upon the plaintiff's motion except upon order of the court

106 pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon him or her of the plaintiff's motion to
107 dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the
108 counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless the
109 court order states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.

120 specifically authorize the recovery of duplicate attorney's fees, court costs, or expenses of
121 litigation.
122 (b) In any civil action, if a party seeks to recover attorney's fees pursuant to any statute
123 authorizing an award of reasonable attorney's fees, a contingent fee agreement between
124 such party and such party's attorney shall not be admissible as proof of the reasonableness
125 of the fees.
126 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall limit or diminish any contractual right to recover
127 attorney's fees, court costs, or expenses of litigation."
128 SECTION 5.

290 (b) In any action for negligent security, in assessing whether an owner or occupier has
291 breached a duty to exercise ordinary care to keep persons on or around any premises safe
292 from wrongful conduct by a third person, the trier of fact shall consider the security
293 measures employed by the owner or occupier at the time of the injury from which the claim
294 of negligent security arises, the need for additional or other security measures, the

313 been, or could be, imposed in a criminal prosecution of any third person for the
314 wrongful conduct from which the claim of negligent security arises;

317 and
318 (3) If a jury fails as the trier of fact to apportion a reasonable degree of fault to the third
319 person whose wrongful conduct was a cause of the injury from which the claim of
320 negligent security arises, the trial court shall set aside the verdict of the jury and order a
321 retrial of liability and damages. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an
322 apportionment of fault is unreasonable if the total percentage of fault apportioned to all
323 third persons for their wrongful conduct is less than the total percentage of fault
324 apportioned to all owners or occupiers, security contractors, and other persons and
325 entities that did not engage in wrongful conduct.
326 51-3-57.
327 (a) If a security contractor assumes and undertakes a duty to invitees and licensees to keep
328 all or part of a premises of an owner or occupier safe from the wrongful conduct of a third
329 person, the security contractor may be liable for negligent security only in the same
330 manner, to the same extent, and subject to the same limitations and provisions applicable
331 to an owner or occupier contained in this article. In no event shall a security contractor be
332 subject to liability for negligent security to an extent greater than the liability for negligent
333 security of an owner or occupier.
334 (b) No security contractor shall be liable for negligent security except as provided in this
335 Code section.
336 (c) Nothing in this Code section shall limit or otherwise affect any claim or remedy of an
337 owner or occupier for breach of contract."
338 SECTION 8.
339 Said title is further amended in Article 1 of Chapter 12, relating to general provisions relative
340 to damages, by adding a new Code section to read as follows:

341 "51-12-1.1.

343 special damages for medical and healthcare expenses shall be recoverable only as provided
344 in this Code section.
345 (b) Special damages for medical and healthcare expenses shall be limited to the expenses
346 of medically necessary care, treatment, or services, and the amount of such special
347 damages shall be limited to:
348 (1) Amounts paid by or on behalf of the plaintiff to healthcare providers for reasonable
349 and customary care, treatment, or services;
350 (2) Amounts necessary to satisfy the incurred but unpaid charges for reasonable and
351 customary care, treatment, or services due to a healthcare provider by the plaintiff or a
352 third party on behalf of the plaintiff; and
353 (3) With respect to medical and healthcare expenses not yet incurred, such amounts as
354 are actually necessary to satisfy future charges for medically necessary care, treatment,
355 or services.
356 (c) If the plaintiff in any such civil action has any form of public or private health
357 insurance that is subject to Code Section 33-24-56.1, including benefits under a
358 governmental workers' compensation program, an unpaid charge for medically necessary
359 care, treatment, or services under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this Code section shall
360 be the amount by which the charge may be satisfied by the claimant's health insurance in
361 addition to the amount representing the plaintiff's responsibility for the portion of the
362 charge under the insurance contract or applicable governmental program, regardless of
363 whether the health insurance has been used, is used, or will be used to satisfy the charge.
364 (d) Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to limit the right of a plaintiff or
365 defendant to present evidence or testimony, or both, challenging the reasonableness of
366 medical and healthcare expenses, whether incurred or projected future expenses, or the
367 medical necessity of any treatment."

370 "51-12-15.
371 In any action to recover for damages for bodily injury or wrongful death, any party may
372 elect, by written demand prior to the entry of the pretrial order, to have liability and any
373 award of damages determined at trial in the following manner:
374 (1) In the first phase of the trial, the trier of fact shall determine the liability of each
375 defendant, and if the trier of fact finds that any defendant is liable to the plaintiff, the trier
376 of fact shall further determine through an appropriate form of the verdict the percentages
377 of fault of all persons or entities that contributed to the injury or wrongful death as
378 provided in Code Section 51-12-33, prior to any determination of the total amount of
379 damages to be awarded, if any such findings are required. The evidence and arguments
380 of counsel in the first phase of the trial shall be limited to the issues provided for in this

387 damages are to be awarded to the plaintiff, the trial may be recommenced for such further
388 proceedings as may be required, including, but not limited to, proceedings provided for
389 in subsection (d) of Code Section 51-12-5.1 concerning punitive damages and
390 proceedings to determine liability for, and the amount of, any attorney's fees, court costs,
