A BILL TO BE ENTITLED
AN ACT
1 To amend Part 3 of Article 4 of Chapter 11 of Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia
2 Annotated, relating to carrying and possession of firearms, so as to prohibit the sale, transfer,
3 use, possession, importation, or manufacture of certain firearms and magazines; to provide
4 for the continued possession of certain firearms and magazines; to provide for exceptions and
5 exemptions; to provide for definitions; to provide for findings; to provide for related matters;
6 to provide an effective date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.
7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:
8 SECTION 1.
9 The General Assembly finds that:
10 (1) Semiautomatic rifles that accept high-capacity magazines pose a significant threat to
11 public safety in that they provide the user of the rifle the ability to fire many rounds of
12 ammunition rapidly and thereby harm many people in a short amount of time;
13 (2) Such semiautomatic rifles have been used in numerous mass shootings around the
14 nation in the recent past, resulting in the death of large numbers of people, many of whom
15 were children; and

16 (3) There is a need to limit the ownership, possession, use, manufacture, and importation
17 of such semiautomatic rifles into this state to reduce the danger to the public from further
18 mass shootings using such rifles.
19 SECTION 2.

21 relating to carrying and possession of firearms, is amended by adding a new Code section to
