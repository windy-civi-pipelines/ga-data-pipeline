31 situation that requires judgment or actions beyond such child's level of maturity,
32 physical abilities, or mental abilities and thereby creating a real, significant, and
33 imminent risk of harm to the child as a result of a blatant disregard for such legal
34 custodian's responsibilities; or
35 (C) The abandonment of a child by his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian;
36 provided, however, that such term shall not include a legal custodian permitting a child

39 substantial risk of harm."
