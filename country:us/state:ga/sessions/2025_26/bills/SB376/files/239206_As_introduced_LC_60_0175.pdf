142 Part 3
143 10-1-975.
144 If a franchisor operates facilities in this state, it may not require higher standards with

156 franchisor. No franchisor shall require any training or qualification for any such person for
157 a period of six months following the death of the franchisee or principal shareholder;
158 provided, however, that, during such period, the surviving spouse, heirs, or estate of the
159 deceased shall maintain all lawful standards and obligations of the franchise.
160 10-1-978.
161 Any condition, stipulation, or provision purporting to bind any person to waive compliance
