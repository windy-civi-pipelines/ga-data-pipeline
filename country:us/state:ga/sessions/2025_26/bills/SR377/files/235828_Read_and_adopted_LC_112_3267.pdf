A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing Rabun County as the Waterfall Capital of Georgia; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, Rabun County, Georgia, located in the Northeast corner of the state, consists
3 of over 240,000 acres, most of which are public lands owned by the United States Forest
4 Service and the Georgia Power Company; and
5 WHEREAS, these thousands of professionally managed acres consist mostly of mountains
6 and watersheds that lend themselves to the formation of abundant waterfalls; and
7 WHEREAS, there are approximately 120 waterfalls in Rabun County including Mud Creek,
8 Hemlock, Minnehaha, Dicks Creek, Martin Creek, Holcomb Creek, and othersâ€”more than
9 double the number of waterfalls in any other county in the Peach State; and
10 WHEREAS, these waterfalls provide recreation and enjoyment for citizens of not only
11 Rabun County but also all citizens of Georgia; and
12 WHEREAS, part of the enjoyment of these waterfalls is known as the "Waterfall Effect,"
13 which occurs when water collides with itself and releases negative ions into the air that are
14 believed to relieve stress, aid sleep, and increase energy in humans; and
