17 "CHAPTER 10
18 46-10-1.
19 The General Assembly recognizes the importance of effective and economical public
20 utilities to the economy of the State of Georgia. It is further recognized that the citizens
21 of Georgia should receive adequate utility services at the lowest reasonable cost to the
22 consumer while maintaining the ability of public utilities to furnish their products and
23 services. It is further recognized that consumers should receive the benefit of technological
24 advances. It is further recognized that the Public Service Commission has been established
25 for the purpose of regulating public utilities and the rates which they charge the consumer
26 and that the commission is responsible for representing the public interest. The General
27 Assembly is aware, however, that the commission must be furnished with all available
28 information concerning the effects of its decisions in rate cases and proceedings before it.
29 It is the purpose of this chapter to ensure that the commission receives such information,
30 particularly in those cases which directly involve the vast majority of Georgia's citizens.
