77 shall be to provide for maintenance and operation costs of the school system. The board

80 combined with other revenues reasonably expected to be received by the school system
81 during the year other than revenues derived from the tax imposed pursuant to
82 subparagraph (c.1) of this Paragraph, would provide revenues sufficient to defray the
83 maintenance and operations expenses of the school system for the year. The millage rate
84 so ascertained shall then be reduced by a millage rate which, if levied against the tangible
85 property within the school district, would produce an amount equal to the distribution of
86 the proceeds of the tax imposed by subparagraph (c.1) of this Paragraph which were
87 received by the school system during the preceding year.
88 (2) A school system may levy and collect both the taxes provided for by subparagraphs

100 district and the independent school districts, or portion thereof, located in such county
101 according to an agreement between the county school system and the independent school
102 district or districts or, if no agreement can be reached, according to the ratio the student
103 enrollment in each school district, or portion thereof, bears to the total student enrollment
104 of all school districts in the county or upon such other formula for distribution as may be
105 authorized by local law. For purposes of this subparagraph, student enrollment shall be
106 based on the latest full-time equivalent count prior to the referendum on imposing the tax.
107 (h) Excess proceeds of the tax provided for by subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph which
108 remain following expenditure of proceeds for authorized projects or purposes for education
109 shall be used solely for the purpose of reducing any indebtedness of the school system. In
110 the event there is no indebtedness, such excess proceeds shall be used by such school
111 system for the purpose of reducing its millage rate in an amount equivalent to the amount
112 of such excess proceeds.
113 (i) The tax taxes authorized by this Paragraph may be imposed, levied, and collected as
114 provided in this Paragraph without further action by the General Assembly, but the General
115 Assembly shall be authorized by general law to further define and implement its provisions
116 including, but not limited to, the authority to specify the percentage of net proceeds to be
117 allocated among the projects and purposes for which the tax provided for by subparagraph
118 (a) of this Paragraph was levied.

124 of any local sales and use tax authorized by general law, or any combination of such
125 taxes, without any corresponding limitation of its ad valorem taxing powers which would
126 otherwise be required under such constitutional amendment.
127 (2) The restriction on and limitation of ad valorem taxing powers described in
128 subparagraph (j)(1) of this Paragraph shall remain applicable with respect to proceeds
129 received from the levy of a local sales and use tax specifically authorized by a
130 constitutional amendment in force and effect pursuant to Article XI, Section I, Paragraph
