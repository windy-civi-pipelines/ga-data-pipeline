41 lot, fines, or otherwise, and all reasonable charges made to any lot owner or lot for
42 materials furnished or services rendered by the association at the owner's request to or on
43 behalf of the lot owner or lot, shall, from the time the sums became due and payable, be
44 the personal obligation of the lot owner, and shall, from the time the association
45 completes its requirements pursuant to Code Section 44-3-237, constitute a lien in favor
46 of the association on the lot prior and superior to all other liens whatsoever except:
