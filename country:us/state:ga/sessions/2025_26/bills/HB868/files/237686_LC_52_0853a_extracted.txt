16 organization, or other health benefits plan offered or provided by a county for its county
17 officers and the spouses and dependents of such officers.
18 (B) 'Eligible county officer' means an individual who is at least the age of 55 and no

22 (2) On and after December 31, 2026, any eligible county officer may elect for himself
23 or herself and the spouse and dependents of such officer to be included in a county health
24 plan. The county governing authority of such officer shall pay 75 percent of any
25 premiums for such plan for such officer and the spouse and dependents of such officer
26 until such officer reaches the age of 65; provided, however, that such premium payment
27 shall not exceed the savings realized by such county based on the total gross salary paid
28 to such officer in his or her final 12 months of service minus the total gross salary due to
29 an individual serving as a new county officer for that position in his or her first 12 months
30 of service, using salaries provided for in Code Sections 15-6-88 through 15-6-91, 15-9-63

36 Commissioners of Georgia to collect and remit such payments as may be required for
37 such officer and the spouse and dependents of such officer to be included in such plan.
38 The Association County Commissioners of Georgia may add a reasonable fee to the

40 it shall be the duty of the Association County Commissioners of Georgia to maintain and
41 remit accurate records and other information as required to administer such plan pursuant
