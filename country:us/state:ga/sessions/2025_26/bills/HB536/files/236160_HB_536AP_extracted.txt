25 LC 62 0067/AP
198 of Fairburn, each member of the authority shall enter upon their duties. A majority of the
199 members of the authority holding office at any time shall constitute a quorum, and no
200 vacancy on the authority shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the rights and
201 perform all the duties of the authority and, in every instance, a majority vote of a quorum
202 shall authorize any legal act of the authority, including all things necessary to authorize and
203 issue revenue bonds and other obligations. The authority shall elect one of its members as
204 chairperson, and from its membership shall elect a secretary and a treasurer. The authority
205 may elect one of its members as a vice chairperson and may elect any number of assistant
206 secretaries or treasurers, who need not be members of the authority, as it may from time to
207 time deem necessary or desirable. The members of the authority shall not be entitled to
208 compensation for their services, but may be reimbursed for their actual expenses necessarily
209 incurred in the performance of their duties. The authority may make rules and regulations
210 for its own governance, and it shall have perpetual existence. Any change in name or

25 LC 62 0067/AP
223 The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds or other obligations shall be a limited
224 obligation of the authority payable solely from the source or sources of funds specified in the
225 indenture or resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds or
226 other obligations. Such revenue bonds or other obligations shall mature on such dates, bear
227 interest at such rate or rates, whether fixed or variable, be subject to redemption, and have
228 such other terms as the authority may provide in the indenture or resolution relating thereto.
229 Such revenue bonds or other obligations shall not be subject to any provision of state law
230 limiting the rate of interest payable thereon and may be sold in a negotiated sale or in a
231 public sale as the authority may determine. Such revenue bonds or other obligations may be
232 issued for cash, property, or other consideration and may be sold in a negotiated sale or in
233 a public sale at such price on such terms as the authority may determine. The offer, sale, or
234 issuance of the authority's revenue bonds or other obligations (including any separate
235 securities securing the same) shall not be subject to regulation under Chapter 5 of Title 10
236 of the O.C.G.A., the "Georgia Uniform Securities Act of 2008," as the same may be amended
237 from time to time.
238 SECTION 7.
239 Revenue bonds or other obligations not a debt or general obligation.
240 Revenue bonds or other obligations issued under the provisions of this Act or any loan
241 incurred as authorized herein shall not constitute a debt or a pledge of the faith and credit of
242 any other public body, but shall be payable solely from the sources as may be designated in
243 the resolution or indenture of the authority authorizing the issuance of the same. The
244 issuance of such obligations shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate any public
245 body to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatsoever for the payment thereof, unless
246 otherwise provided by an intergovernmental contract executed by such public body. No
247 holder of any bond or other obligation or receiver or trustee in connection therewith shall
H. B. 536
- 10 -
25 LC 62 0067/AP
248 have the right to enforce the payment thereof against any property of any other public body
249 nor shall any such bond or other obligation constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal
250 or equitable, upon any such property unless otherwise provided by an intergovernmental
251 contract executed by such other public body and the authority. All such obligations shall
252 contain on their face a recital setting forth substantially the foregoing provisions of this
253 section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any other public body from
254 obligating itself to pay the amounts required under any intergovernmental contract entered
255 into with the authority pursuant to Article IX of the Constitution of Georgia or any successor
256 provision, including (if such other public body has taxing power) from funds received from
257 taxes to be levied and collected by such other public body for that purpose and from any
258 other source.
259 SECTION 8.
260 Issuance of bonds or obligations under indentures or resolutions.
261 In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds or other obligations
262 may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a trustee, which may
263 be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the
264 state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, rents, revenues, and earnings to
265 be received by the authority including the proceeds derived from the financing, sale, or lease,
266 or operation from time to time, of any project. Either the resolution providing for the
267 issuance of revenue bonds or other obligations or such trust indenture may contain such
268 provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the owners of such bonds
269 or obligations as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including
270 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority or any lessee or purchaser in relation to the
271 acquisition and construction of any project; the maintenance, operation, repair, and financing
272 of any project; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, including the
H. B. 536
- 11 -
25 LC 62 0067/AP
273 proceeds derived from the sale or lease of any project or from the sale of any such revenue
274 bonds or other obligations; and may contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any,
275 upon which additional bonds or other obligations may be issued, whether on a parity with or
276 subordinate to any other obligations issued by the authority. Such indenture or resolution
277 may set forth the rights and remedies of the owners of such obligations and of the trustee.
278 In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the
279 authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the owners of such bonds or
280 other obligations or otherwise necessary or convenient in connection with the issuance of
281 such obligations. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated
282 as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such
283 indenture.
284 SECTION 9.
285 Security for the payment of bonds or other obligations.
286 The authority may assign or pledge any property, or revenues and its interest in any
287 contracts, lease agreements, or installment sales agreements, or the amounts payable
288 thereunder, to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds and other
289 obligations of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or other
290 obligations or the trust indenture may provide. The use and disposition of such property or
291 revenues assigned to the payment of bonds or other obligations shall be subject to the
292 indenture or resolution authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds or obligations. Any
293 lien created by the authority for the payment of such bonds or obligations may be a first lien
294 or a subordinate lien as the authority may provide, and any such indenture or resolution may
295 provide, at the option of the authority, for the issuance of additional bonds or other
296 obligations sharing any lien on a parity or subordinate lien basis.

298 Refunding bonds or obligations.
299 The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of obligations, whether
300 revenue bonds or other obligations, for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds or other
301 obligations issued under the provisions of this Act or under any other provision of state law
302 so long as such bonds or other obligations were issued for a purpose or project for which the
303 authority could issue bonds or other obligations. The issuance of such refunding bonds or
304 other obligations and all the details thereof, the rights of holders thereof, and the duties of the
305 authority with respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act
306 insofar as the same may be applicable.
307 SECTION 11.
308 Principal office; venue.
309 The principal office of the authority shall be in the City of Fairburn, and the venue of any
310 action against it shall be in Fulton County. Service upon the authority of any process,
311 subpoena, or summons shall be effected by serving the same personally upon any member
312 of the authority.
313 SECTION 12.
314 Validation of revenue bonds; elective validation of other obligations.
315 Revenue bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the
316 procedure now or hereafter set forth in Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A.,
317 known as the "Revenue Bond Law," as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended.
318 At the election of the authority, other obligations of the authority may be validated as if they
H. B. 536
- 13 -
25 LC 62 0067/AP
319 were revenue bonds. The petition for validation shall name the authority as a defendant and
320 may also make a party defendant to such action any other private person or public body that
321 has or will contract with the authority with respect to the project for which revenue bonds or
322 other obligations are to be issued and are sought to be validated. The bonds or other
323 obligations, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with
324 respect to the validity of such bonds or other obligations and the security therefor against the
325 authority and other parties to the validation and against all other private persons and public
326 bodies, regardless of whether such private persons or public bodies were parties to such
327 validation proceedings. Any action pertaining to the validation of any revenue bonds or
328 other obligations issued under the provisions of this Act and for the validation of any
329 instruments entered or to be entered into by the authority or other private persons or public
330 bodies securing the same shall be brought in the Superior Court of Fulton County, and such
331 court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of such actions.
332 SECTION 13.
333 No impairment of rights.
334 While any of the bonds or other obligations issued by the authority or any interests in
335 contracts of the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority
336 or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that
337 will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds or obligations or
338 such interests in contracts of the authority. The provisions of this section of this Act shall
339 be for the benefit of the authority and of the holders of any such bonds or obligations and
340 interests in contracts of the authority and, upon the issuance of bonds or obligations or the
341 creation of interests in contracts of the authority under the provisions of this Act, shall
342 constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds or obligations or such interests in
343 contracts of the authority.

347 of revenue bonds or obligations of the authority, as grants or other contributions, or as
348 revenues, income, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied
349 solely as provided in this Act and in such resolutions and trust indentures as may be adopted

351 invested from time to time in such investments as may be permitted under the indenture,
352 agreement, or resolution establishing the fund or account in which such funds are held, or if
353 not held in such a fund or account, in such investments as would be permitted for

355 O.C.G.A.

361 leases, concessions, and subleases of its projects, and to determine the price and terms at and
362 under which its projects may be sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of. The authority may
363 establish in its discretion procedures for contracting for any work done for the authority or
364 for the acquisition, sale, transfer, lease, management, or operation of any property, real or

25 LC 62 0067/AP
198 of Fairburn, each member of the authority shall enter upon their duties. A majority of the
199 members of the authority holding office at any time shall constitute a quorum, and no
200 vacancy on the authority shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the rights and
201 perform all the duties of the authority and, in every instance, a majority vote of a quorum
202 shall authorize any legal act of the authority, including all things necessary to authorize and
203 issue revenue bonds and other obligations. The authority shall elect one of its members as
204 chairperson, and from its membership shall elect a secretary and a treasurer. The authority
205 may elect one of its members as a vice chairperson and may elect any number of assistant
206 secretaries or treasurers, who need not be members of the authority, as it may from time to
207 time deem necessary or desirable. The members of the authority shall not be entitled to

218 other obligations for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any one or more
219 projects, including the cost of constructing, reconstructing, equipping, extending, adding to,
220 or improving any such project, or for the purpose of refunding, as herein provided, any such
221 bonds or other obligations of the authority or to refund bonds or other obligations of any
222 other authority or public body previously issued to finance or refinance the cost of a project.
H. B. 536
- 9 -

25 LC 62 0067/AP
223 The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds or other obligations shall be a limited
224 obligation of the authority payable solely from the source or sources of funds specified in the
225 indenture or resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds or
226 other obligations. Such revenue bonds or other obligations shall mature on such dates, bear
227 interest at such rate or rates, whether fixed or variable, be subject to redemption, and have
228 such other terms as the authority may provide in the indenture or resolution relating thereto.
229 Such revenue bonds or other obligations shall not be subject to any provision of state law
230 limiting the rate of interest payable thereon and may be sold in a negotiated sale or in a
231 public sale as the authority may determine. Such revenue bonds or other obligations may be
232 issued for cash, property, or other consideration and may be sold in a negotiated sale or in
233 a public sale at such price on such terms as the authority may determine. The offer, sale, or
234 issuance of the authority's revenue bonds or other obligations (including any separate
235 securities securing the same) shall not be subject to regulation under Chapter 5 of Title 10
236 of the O.C.G.A., the "Georgia Uniform Securities Act of 2008," as the same may be amended
237 from time to time.
238 SECTION 7.
239 Revenue bonds or other obligations not a debt or general obligation.
240 Revenue bonds or other obligations issued under the provisions of this Act or any loan
241 incurred as authorized herein shall not constitute a debt or a pledge of the faith and credit of
242 any other public body, but shall be payable solely from the sources as may be designated in
243 the resolution or indenture of the authority authorizing the issuance of the same. The
244 issuance of such obligations shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate any public
245 body to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatsoever for the payment thereof, unless
246 otherwise provided by an intergovernmental contract executed by such public body. No
247 holder of any bond or other obligation or receiver or trustee in connection therewith shall
H. B. 536
- 10 -

25 LC 62 0067/AP
248 have the right to enforce the payment thereof against any property of any other public body
249 nor shall any such bond or other obligation constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal
250 or equitable, upon any such property unless otherwise provided by an intergovernmental
251 contract executed by such other public body and the authority. All such obligations shall
252 contain on their face a recital setting forth substantially the foregoing provisions of this
253 section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any other public body from
254 obligating itself to pay the amounts required under any intergovernmental contract entered
255 into with the authority pursuant to Article IX of the Constitution of Georgia or any successor
256 provision, including (if such other public body has taxing power) from funds received from
257 taxes to be levied and collected by such other public body for that purpose and from any
258 other source.
259 SECTION 8.
260 Issuance of bonds or obligations under indentures or resolutions.
261 In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds or other obligations
262 may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a trustee, which may
263 be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the
264 state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, rents, revenues, and earnings to
265 be received by the authority including the proceeds derived from the financing, sale, or lease,
266 or operation from time to time, of any project. Either the resolution providing for the
267 issuance of revenue bonds or other obligations or such trust indenture may contain such
268 provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the owners of such bonds
269 or obligations as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including
270 covenants setting forth the duties of the authority or any lessee or purchaser in relation to the
271 acquisition and construction of any project; the maintenance, operation, repair, and financing
272 of any project; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, including the
H. B. 536
- 11 -

25 LC 62 0067/AP
273 proceeds derived from the sale or lease of any project or from the sale of any such revenue
274 bonds or other obligations; and may contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any,
275 upon which additional bonds or other obligations may be issued, whether on a parity with or
276 subordinate to any other obligations issued by the authority. Such indenture or resolution
277 may set forth the rights and remedies of the owners of such obligations and of the trustee.
278 In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the
279 authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the owners of such bonds or
280 other obligations or otherwise necessary or convenient in connection with the issuance of
281 such obligations. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated
282 as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such
283 indenture.
284 SECTION 9.
285 Security for the payment of bonds or other obligations.
286 The authority may assign or pledge any property, or revenues and its interest in any
287 contracts, lease agreements, or installment sales agreements, or the amounts payable
288 thereunder, to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds and other
289 obligations of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or other
290 obligations or the trust indenture may provide. The use and disposition of such property or
291 revenues assigned to the payment of bonds or other obligations shall be subject to the
292 indenture or resolution authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds or obligations. Any
293 lien created by the authority for the payment of such bonds or obligations may be a first lien

321 has or will contract with the authority with respect to the project for which revenue bonds or
322 other obligations are to be issued and are sought to be validated. The bonds or other
323 obligations, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with

325 authority and other parties to the validation and against all other private persons and public
326 bodies, regardless of whether such private persons or public bodies were parties to such
327 validation proceedings. Any action pertaining to the validation of any revenue bonds or
328 other obligations issued under the provisions of this Act and for the validation of any
329 instruments entered or to be entered into by the authority or other private persons or public
330 bodies securing the same shall be brought in the Superior Court of Fulton County, and such

336 or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that
337 will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds or obligations or
338 such interests in contracts of the authority. The provisions of this section of this Act shall
339 be for the benefit of the authority and of the holders of any such bonds or obligations and
340 interests in contracts of the authority and, upon the issuance of bonds or obligations or the
341 creation of interests in contracts of the authority under the provisions of this Act, shall
342 constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds or obligations or such interests in
343 contracts of the authority.
