8 SECTION 1.
9 (a) The General Assembly finds and determines that it is appropriate and advisable to

11 the assessment of taxes.
12 (b) The General Assembly further finds and declares that by allowing for a local option of
13 using the most recent sales price for property as the method for determining the value of
14 property would lead to the following beneficial effects:
15 (1) Provide greater transparency for taxpayers;
16 (2) Eliminate ambiguity in the annual appraisal and assessment process;

21 (6) Reduce administrative costs related to preparing and mailing annual appraisals and
22 assessments;

26 (9) Require less time and resources for state approval of the digest;
27 (10) Help eliminate the annual discussions on capping value increases on real property;

33 homes.
34 SECTION 2.
35 Article VII, Section I of the Constitution is amended in Paragraph III by adding a new
36 subparagraph to read as follows:
37 "(i)(1)(A) The governing authority of any county or consolidated government shall
38 be authorized to adopt an alternative method of appraising and assessing real property
39 for ad valorem taxes levied for all purposes within the county in accordance with the
40 provisions of this subparagraph (i).
41 (B) A governing authority may initiate or revoke the use of such alternative method
42 prescribed by this subparagraph (i) upon passage of an ordinance or resolution by a

43 majority of such governing authority. A governing authority may provide that the
44 effectiveness of such ordinance or resolution shall be contingent upon approval of a
45 majority of voters in a referendum thereon. However, a revocation by a governing
46 authority shall not occur within five years from the date the alternative method initially
47 becomes effective.
48 (2) The alternative method of appraising and assessing real property for ad valorem
49 taxation shall use the appraised fair market value as of January 1 of the year following
50 the adoption of such alternative method as shown on the tax digest of the county on such
51 date for such real property. Thereafter, the appraised fair market value of the property
52 shall be the most recent purchase price for such property unless there is a substantial
53 improvement made to the property. A substantial improvement shall be the construction
54 of, an addition to, or replacement of structures on such real estate that increase the fair
55 market value of the real estate by an amount in excess of $50,000.00. Upon such event,
56 the property may be reappraised and reassessed and the fair market value reestablished
57 for ad valorem tax purposes. The appraised value of such real property shall change only
58 upon a subsequent transfer of such property or a substantial improvement to the property.
59 (3) The alternative method of appraising and assessing real property for ad valorem
60 taxation shall be uniform for all real property within the county. Real property appraised
61 pursuant to this alternative method shall be assessed for taxation at the same rate and
62 percentage of value as all other tangible property in the county.
63 (4) The implementation and administration of this subparagraph (i) shall be further
64 provided by general law in a manner consistent with this subparagraph (i)."
65 SECTION 3.
66 The above proposed amendment to the Constitution shall be published and submitted as
67 provided in Article X, Section I, Paragraph II of the Constitution. The ballot submitting the
68 above proposed amendment shall have written or printed thereon the following:
