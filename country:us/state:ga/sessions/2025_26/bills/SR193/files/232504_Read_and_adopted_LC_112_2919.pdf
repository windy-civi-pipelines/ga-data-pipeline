A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing and commending Troy Taylor; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, Troy Taylor's interest in art began while working as a fine art poster repair clerk
3 at Bruce McGaw Graphics during his sophomore year of college, a passion that steadily grew
4 during his distinguished career in engineering and corporate leadership; and
5 WHEREAS, in 2009, inspired by his global travels, he founded ZuCot Gallery in Atlanta's
6 Castleberry Hill neighborhood, transforming a dirt-floor commercial space into a
7 contemporary fine arts gallery; and
8 WHEREAS, he named the gallery in tribute to his paternal grandmother, Frances Ann
9 Taylor, who was among the first women permitted to own a stall in the local produce market
10 within the British colony of Saint Christopher, now St. Kitts, where she developed the
11 reputation of being "as tough as a ZOO CAT"; and
12 WHEREAS, in 2011, Troy Taylor attended an art show held by Onaje and Omari Henderson,
13 owners of Premier Art, who had built a platform to showcase and market African American
14 artists after recognizing a gap in art education and accessibility; and

15 WHEREAS, Troy Taylor partnered with the Henderson brothers in 2012 to re-brand ZuCot
16 Gallery with a primary focus on the works of living African American artists, forming "The
17 Art Brothers" and adopting the philosophy that art is a reflection of one's personal character
18 and values; and
19 WHEREAS, ZuCot Gallery has since grown into the largest African American fine arts
20 gallery in the southeastern United States, representing artists from across the country and
21 attracting a diverse clientele; and
22 WHEREAS, the gallery has hosted countless events for congressmen, senators, supreme
23 court justices, mayors, professional organizations, Fortune 500 companies, students, and the
24 public, earning its reputation as a hub for networking, education, and cultural engagement;
25 and
26 WHEREAS, it is abundantly fitting and proper that this remarkable individual be
27 appropriately honored.
28 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE that the members of this body
29 recognize and commend Troy Taylor, founder of ZuCot Gallery, for his many outstanding
30 contributions on behalf of the arts as well as extend best wishes for continued success.
31 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed
32 to make an appropriate copy of this resolution available for distribution to Troy Taylor.
