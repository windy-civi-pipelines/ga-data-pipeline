A RESOLUTION
1 Expressing support for the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank; and for other purposes.
2 WHEREAS, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) stated in its 2021 report card
3 that the United States received a grade of C- regarding the current state of infrastructure and
4 that more than six trillion dollars would be needed to restore the nation's infrastructure to a
5 state of good repair. Over three trillion dollars is currently not funded, and the remainder is
6 inadequately funded. New 21st Century projects are unfunded; and
7 WHEREAS, the State of Georgia received a C+ grade from the ASCE in 2024. Transit was
8 graded D, Roads C+, Storm water C-, Wastewater C-, Dams D+, Aviation C+, Drinking
9 water C+, and Solid Waste C+; and
10 WHEREAS, half of all Georgians do not have access to public sewer service, and wastewater
11 needs total $2.7 billion; Atlanta ranks No. 8 nationally in traffic congestion (average cost per
12 driver is $1,510 per year); and
13 WHEREAS, more than 654,000 renters pay more than 30 percent of their income toward
14 rent, and there is a shortage of at least 214,000 new units of affordable rental homes in the
15 state for the most housing insecure; and

25 LC 112 2809
16 WHEREAS, there are at least 86,000 lead service lines in Georgia, 31,000 of which are in
17 Atlanta, requiring $1 billion to replace; and
18 WHEREAS, Congress introduced HR 4052, The National Infrastructure Bank Act, to create
19 a new National Infrastructure Bank (NIB). It will be capitalized by existing Treasury debt
20 and require no new federal appropriations or federal taxes. It will invest five trillion dollars
21 into infrastructure only and create 25 million new high-wage jobs; and
22 WHEREAS, the NIB is modeled on previous banks that helped build much of our
23 infrastructure under Presidents George Washington, James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, and
24 Franklin D. Roosevelt. The last such bank helped bring us out of the Depression and win
25 World War II; and
26 WHEREAS, the NIB will address all the infrastructure needs of the State of Georgia not
27 covered by existing state or federal funding. It will repair all hard infrastructure, including
28 roads, bridges, schools, all needed affordable housing units, sewers, lead service lines,
29 drinking water, and much more. It will build new projects, including expanded passenger and
30 high-speed rail service; and
31 WHEREAS, the NIB will pay prevailing wages and enforce a Buy America policy. It will
32 massively expand small and medium-sized businesses in the state and ensure significant
33 participation of Disadvantaged Minority Enterprises. The NIB will invest in rural and urban
34 communities. Economists estimate the bank will grow the economy by 5 percent per year,
35 as did its predecessors; and
36 WHEREAS, many organizations have issued statements of support. Twenty-nine state
37 legislatures filed or passed resolutions, as have county and city councils. Endorsements
