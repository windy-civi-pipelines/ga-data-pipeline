17 as retirement benefits for military service. Such rules shall include the determination and
18 use of an appropriate cost-of-living index which reflects the effects of inflation and
19 deflation on persons receiving retirement income in this state for military service in the
20 armed forces of the United States or the reserve components thereof. In the regulation
21 of such rules, the commissioner may use the Consumer Price Index as reported by the
22 Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor as such index is used
23 to determine adjustments to social security payments or any other similar index
24 established by the federal government if the commissioner determines that such federal
25 index reflects the effects of inflation and deflation on persons receiving retirement
26 income in this state for military service in the armed forces of the United States or the
27 reserve components thereof. Any such cost-of-living adjustment determined appropriate
28 by the commissioner shall result in a proportional adjustment to the amount of military
29 retirement income excluded from Georgia taxable net income."
30 SECTION 2.

32 beginning on or after January 1, 2026.
