18 SECTION 2.
19 Said article is further amended in Code Section 48-9-3, relating to levy of excise tax, rate,
20 taxation of motor fuels not commonly sold or measured by gallon, rate, prohibition of tax on
21 motor fuel by political subdivisions, exception, and exempted sales, by revising
22 paragraph (2) of subsection (a) and subdivision (b)(7)(B)(ii)(I) as follows:
23 "(2) In the event any motor fuels which are not commonly sold or measured by the gallon
24 or which are not otherwise provided for by this Code section are used in any motor
25 vehicles on the public highways of this state, the commissioner may assess, levy, and
26 collect a tax upon such fuels, under such regulations as the commissioner may
27 promulgate, in accordance with and measured by the nearest power potential equivalent
28 to that of one gallon of regular grade gasoline; provided, however, that no tax shall be
29 collected upon such fuel dispensed from an electric vehicle charging station that is owned
30 or operated by a nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of
31 the Internal Revenue Code, that delivers electricity for no exchange of consideration or
32 payment, and that is located upon federal interstate right of way. Any determination by
33 the commissioner of the power potential equivalent of such motor fuels shall be
34 prima-facie correct. Upon each such quantity of such fuels used upon the public
35 highways of this state, a tax at the same rate per gallon imposed on motor fuel under
36 paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be assessed and collected."
37 "(ii)(I) Any special fuel sold by a distributor to a purchaser who has a storage
38 receptacle which has a connection to a withdrawal outlet that may be used for
39 highway use, as defined in paragraph (8) of Code Section 48-9-2, and any special
40 fuel delivered from an electric vehicle charging station, is not exempt from the
41 motor fuel and road taxes imposed by this article unless: (1) the purchaser is at the
42 time of sale a valid licensed distributor of that type of motor fuel, or (2) such fuel
43 dispensed is from an electric vehicle charging station that is owned or operated by
44 a nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the

45 Internal Revenue Code, that delivers electricity for no exchange of consideration or
46 payment, and that is located upon federal interstate right of way, or (3) an
47 exemption certificate has been obtained on forms furnished by the Department of
48 Revenue showing that there is no highway use of such fuels and the person
49 obtaining such fuel is not a reseller of such fuels. Each exemption certificate shall
50 be valid for a period of not more than three years and shall be kept by the distributor
51 as one of the records specified in Code Section 48-9-8. It shall be the responsibility
52 of the purchaser to notify the distributor when the purchaser is no longer qualified
53 for the nonhighway exemption. All applicable taxes must shall be charged the
54 purchaser until the purchaser is granted a valid distributor's license for that type of
55 motor fuel."
56 SECTION 3.
57 This Act shall become effective on January 1, 2026.
