133 jobs being available when weighed against what social and societal ills may come to Georgia

149 WHEREAS, the financial implications for the state of such potential legalization as well as
150 previously considered measures by the General Assembly to improve Georgia's economy
151 deserve to be further considered and studied along with the social, fiscal, and economic
