96 relating to emergency telephone number 9-1-1 system, is amended in Code Section 46-5-134,
97 relating to billing of subscribers, liability of subscriber for service charge, taxes on service,
98 establishment of Emergency Telephone System Fund, cost recovery fee, records, and use of
99 funds, by revising subsection (a) as follows:
100 "(a)(1)(A)(i) Unless exempt, the telephone subscriber of any telephone service shall
101 be billed for the monthly 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to such telephone
102 service by the service supplier. Such Beginning on July 1, 2026, such 9-1-1 charge
103 shall be $1.50 $2.50 per month per telephone service provided to the telephone
104 subscriber except as reduced pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection (d) of this Code
105 section.
106 (ii) In computing the amount due under this subsection, the number of 9-1-1 charges
107 a telephone subscriber shall be assessed shall not exceed the number of simultaneous
108 outbound calls that can be made from voice channels the service supplier has
109 activated and enabled. For telephone service that provides to multiple locations
110 shared simultaneous outbound voice channel capacity configured to and capable of
111 accessing a 9-1-1 system in different states, the monthly 9-1-1 charge shall be
112 assessed only for the portion of such shared voice channel capacity in this state as
113 identified by the service supplier's books and records. In determining the portion of
114 shared capacity in this state, a service supplier may rely on, among other factors, a
115 customer's certification of its allocation of capacity in this state, which may be based
116 on each end user location, the total number of end users, and the number of end users
117 at each end user location.
118 (B) All telephone services billed to federal, state, or local governments shall be exempt
119 from the 9-1-1 charge. Each service supplier shall, on behalf of the local government,

121 telephone service in the area served by the emergency 9-1-1 system. As part of its
122 normal billing process, the service supplier shall collect the 9-1-1 charge for each
123 month a telephone service is in service, and it shall list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate
124 entry on each bill. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require a service
125 supplier to list the 9-1-1 charge as a surcharge or separate entry on each bill. Service
126 suppliers that do not list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill shall remit the
127 9-1-1 charge for each telephone subscriber that pays the bill; provided, however, that
128 this information shall be maintained in a form auditors can access. If a service supplier
129 receives a partial payment for a bill from a telephone subscriber, the service supplier
130 shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber owes the service
131 supplier first.
132 (C) This paragraph shall not apply to wireless service or prepaid wireless service or the
133 telephone subscribers or service suppliers of such services.

136 automatic number identification of a wireless telecommunications connection and the
137 location of the base station or cell site which receives a 9-1-1 call from a wireless
138 telecommunications connection, the subscriber of a wireless telecommunications
139 connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is served by
140 the local government or that would be served by the local government for the purpose
141 of such a public safety answering point may be billed for the monthly wireless
142 enhanced 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to that connection by the wireless
143 service supplier. Such Beginning on July 1, 2026, such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge
144 shall be $1.50 $2.50 per month per wireless telecommunications connection provided
145 to the telephone subscriber except as otherwise provided in paragraph (4) of subsection
146 (d) of this Code section.

147 (B) If the governing body of a local government operates or contracts for the operation
148 of an emergency 9-1-1 system which is capable of providing or provides automatic
149 number identification and automatic location identification of a wireless
150 telecommunications connection, the subscriber of a wireless telecommunications
151 connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is served by
152 the local government or that would be served by the local government for the purpose
153 of such an emergency 9-1-1 system may be billed for the monthly wireless
154 enhanced 9-1-1 charge, if any, imposed with respect to that connection by the wireless
155 service supplier. Such wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge may not exceed the amount of
156 the monthly 9-1-1 charge imposed upon other telephone subscribers pursuant to
157 paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall be imposed on a monthly basis for each
158 wireless telecommunications connection provided to the telephone subscriber.
159 (C) All wireless telecommunications connections billed to federal, state, or local
160 governments shall be exempt from the wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge. Each wireless
161 service supplier shall, on behalf of the local government, collect the wireless enhanced
162 9-1-1 charge from those telephone subscribers whose place of primary use is within the
163 geographic area that is served by the local government or that would be served by the
164 local government for the purpose of such an emergency 9-1-1 system. As part of its
165 normal billing process, the wireless service supplier shall collect the wireless
166 enhanced 9-1-1 charge for each month a wireless telecommunications connection is in
167 service, and it may list the wireless enhanced 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each
168 bill. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require a wireless service
169 supplier to list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill. Wireless service
170 suppliers that do not list the 9-1-1 charge as a separate entry on each bill shall remit
171 the 9-1-1 charge for each telephone subscriber that pays the bill; provided, however,
172 that this information shall be maintained in a form auditors can access. If a wireless
173 service supplier receives partial payment for a bill from a telephone subscriber, the
S. B. 342
- 7 -

174 wireless service supplier shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone
175 subscriber owes the wireless service supplier first.
176 (D) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the application of any 9-1-1 service charge with
177 respect to a mobile telecommunications service, as defined in 4 U.S.C. Section 124(7),
178 shall be governed by the provisions of Code Section 48-8-6.

180 subscribers or service suppliers of such service."

186 including counties and municipalities that operate multijurisdictional or regional 9-1-1
187 systems or have created a joint authority pursuant to Code Section 46-5-138, are
188 authorized to impose by ordinance or resolution a prepaid wireless 9-1-1 charge in the
189 amount of $1.50 $2.50 per retail transaction. Imposition of the charge authorized by this
190 Code section by a county or municipality shall be contingent upon compliance with the
191 requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (j) of this Code section. Any charge imposed
192 by ordinance pursuant to this subsection prior to July 1, 2026, shall, beginning on July
193 1, 2026, be in the amount of $2.50.
