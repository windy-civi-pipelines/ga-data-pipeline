House Resolution 466
A RESOLUTION
1 Recognizing the historical significance of the 1911 Rand McNally map of Dawson County,
2 Georgia; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the 1911 Rand McNally map of Dawson County, Georgia, provides a valuable
4 historical snapshot of the region's geography, infrastructure, and cultural landmarks as they
5 existed in the early 20th century; and

9 Johntown, Juno, Landrum, Laurel, McKee, Palmour, Pots Mountain, Rockpile, Sarepta,
10 Warhill, and Yellowcreek, each of which played a significant role in the area's development
11 yet, over time, has been lost or absorbed into larger towns or counties; and

13 families who were integral to the county's early growth; though the town has largely
14 disappeared, its agricultural legacy remains a part of Dawson County's historical fabric; and

15 WHEREAS, Amicalola, named after the nearby Amicalola Falls, was a center for early
16 tourism and a gathering place for people enjoying the natural beauty of the area; though the
17 town has faded, Amicalola Falls State Park continues to draw visitors to the region; and
18 WHEREAS, Barrettsville, a settlement that grew around early roadways and trade, once
19 served as a crossroads for travelers and commerce; though no longer a recognized
20 community, its role in facilitating early economic activity is an important chapter in Dawson
21 County's history; and
22 WHEREAS, Bright, a small agricultural settlement, was home to farms that helped feed the
23 local population, and its location along early transportation routes made it a vital part of
24 Dawson County's rural economy; and
25 WHEREAS, Cogburn, an early mill town, served as a critical source of local industry,
26 providing employment and economic stability to the area for many years; though now a
27 distant memory, the community's industrial past still influences the development of
28 surrounding areas; and
29 WHEREAS, Dawsonville, the county seat, remains a thriving town that has grown from its
30 early history as a bustling center of trade and commerce; its historical significance is
31 celebrated today, even as it continues to evolve into a modern community; and
32 WHEREAS, Dougherty, a small farming community, once contributed to the agricultural
33 wealth of Dawson County, and though it has long since been absorbed into surrounding
34 areas, its presence on the early map serves as a reminder of the county's agrarian past; and

35 WHEREAS, Fork, a settlement once situated at a key junction of early roads, played an
36 important role in the transportation networks that connected Dawson County with other parts
37 of Georgia—its location near multiple crossroads made it a vital stop for travelers; and
38 WHEREAS, Hubbardsville, an early logging community, helped fuel the industrial growth
39 of Dawson County by supplying timber for the burgeoning building industry—the area's
40 natural resources were once central to the county's economy, and Hubbardsville was one of
41 its key contributors; and
42 WHEREAS, Johntown, a settlement that arose alongside the rise of mining activities, saw
43 a brief period of prosperity before the mines played out and the town faded from the map;
44 its once-prominent role in the mining industry is now remembered by historians; and
45 WHEREAS, Juno, a small community that grew up near the mining and logging operations,
46 served as a key location for industry and trade; today, little remains of Juno, but its role in
47 shaping the area's early economy endures in local memory; and
48 WHEREAS, Landrum, once a farm town known for its rich soil and crops, was part of

58 agriculture and trade—its absence today is a reminder of the changing nature of Dawson
59 County's rural economy; and

61 provided key natural resources that helped fuel the economy of Dawson County in its early
62 years; and

64 Dawson County to surrounding areas and was a central location for commerce during its
65 peak; and

75 WHEREAS, the map illustrates the layout of early transportation networks, including historic
76 roadways, railways, and settlements that shaped the development of small towns and rural
77 communities within Dawson County; and

79 a way of life that has since evolved due to industrialization, urbanization, and shifts in

81 WHEREAS, preserving and recognizing this historical cartographic record allows for a
82 deeper appreciation of the county's heritage and provides insight into how the landscape and
83 society have changed over time; and

85 to the broader understanding of Georgia's small-town history and the forces that shaped its
86 development throughout the 20th century.
87 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
88 the members of this body recognize the historical significance of the 1911 Rand McNally
89 map of Dawson County, Georgia, and encourage further efforts to document, study, and
90 educate the public about the county's evolving geography and cultural legacy.
