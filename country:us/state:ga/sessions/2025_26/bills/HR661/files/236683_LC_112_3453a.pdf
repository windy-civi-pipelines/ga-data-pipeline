House Resolution 661
By: Representatives McClain of the 109th, Buckner of the 137th, Alexander of the 66th, Taylor
of the 92nd, Tran of the 80th, and others
A RESOLUTION
1 Urging the Federal Railroad Administration to deny CSX's request to become the first
2 railroad to use Trip Optimizer's Zero-to-Zero feature; and for other purposes.
3 WHEREAS, the safety of Georgians is the paramount duty of government; and
4 WHEREAS, numerous train accidents have caused enormous damage to human life and
5 property in recent years; and
6 WHEREAS, the safety of train operations impacts communities across this state and the
7 country; and
8 WHEREAS, CSX has applied to the Federal Railroad Administration to become the first
9 railroad to use Trip Optimizer's Zero-to-Zero feature, which allows the cruise-control system
10 to automatically start and stop trains from beginning to end; and
11 WHEREAS, a computer system or algorithm cannot replace the skill, judgment, and
12 adaptability of a trained engineer and conductor; therefore, allowing a system that relies
13 solely on technology to control the brakes—the train's most essential safety feature—is
14 dangerous; and

15 WHEREAS, the Federal Railroad Administration finalized a two-person crew rule in 2024,
16 establishing two-person crews and barring engineer-only operation on most trains; and
17 WHEREAS, Trip Optimizer with Air Brake Control is a precursor to autonomous train
18 operation; and
19 WHEREAS, Zero-to-Zero has yet to be tested systemwide and has only been tested on
20 approximately 25 percent of CSX territory, leaving too many unanswered questions for it to
21 be implemented systemwide; and
22 WHEREAS, becoming a skilled and efficient locomotive engineer requires years of
23 locomotive operation, but Zero-to-Zero usage does not allow newly promoted engineers to
24 continually develop their train operation skills; and
25 WHEREAS, Trip Optimizer usage does not allow experienced locomotive engineers to
26 continue refining their skills as trains become longer and heavier, all of which handle
27 differently, and its continued use diminishes the skills of experienced engineers due to the
28 lack of manual operation; and
29 WHEREAS, the Trip Optimizer system on locomotives malfunctions daily, failing to operate
30 trains smoothly and allowing for excessive draft and buff forces within the train, which can
31 cause train separation, block crossings, delay emergency response vehicles, and lead to
32 derailments that put communities at risk; and
33 WHEREAS, the Georgia Working Families Legislative Caucus urges the Georgia State
34 Senate to call on the Federal Railroad Administration to deny CSX's request to use Trip

35 Optimizer's Zero-to-Zero feature, which allows the system to automatically start and stop
36 trains when moving from zero to nine miles per hour.
37 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that
38 the members of this body urge the Federal Railroad Administration to deny CSX's request
39 to use Trip Optimizer's Zero-to-Zero feature, which allows the system to automatically start
40 and stop trains when moving from zero to nine miles per hour.
41 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized
42 and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the
43 public and the press.
